This library is used in a lot of interesting projects such as terrainServer and worldviz. Currently, the terrainServer offers Web-based services providing perspective terrain views. The idea of this project is to extend Terrain model generation and analysis to practical scenarios, where it would be desirable to have Web-based access to analysis tools (e.g., difference surfaces, mass calculations, inclination analysis) and to model generation functions, using the Triturus library. In the Google Summer of Code program, we shall try to achieve Web-based access for few of these tools. This module will be named ‘terrainTools’ and will be a standalone project.",

However, local community search queries are still needed in Rogas framework. In a local community search query, the objective is to find the communities that are associated with a given set of query vertices. Implementation of local community search functionality needs careful modeling into NAER model as well.The proposed project aims at adding the local community search functionality into Rogas. This makes Rogas a more general framework that covers a broader range of network analytics applications. Moreover, this project aims at implementing and instantiation of three local community detection techniques chosen from the state-of-the-art ones in the field of network analytics. This can bring Rogas a new level of functionality with a more detailed coverage of network analytics applications.",

The runtime of the application was 47 seconds with the default serializers and 35 seconds with the handwritten ones. After switching to handwritten serializers, the number of samples in java.lang.reflect, org.apache.flink.api.java.typeutils.runtime, and sun.reflect was reduced to 36% from 54%. The majority of the rest of the calls to java.lang.reflect are from the comparators. The number of garbage collections was also significantly reduced. Similarly, by adding handwritten serializer to the POJO word count example could reduce the runtime from 9.5s to 8s on a 100mb input file. Note that, these benchmarks did not measure the potential speedups from the rework of the tuple serializer and the comparators.",

For example, it could be interesting to calculate the abundance (by area) of regions like angiogenesis, necrosis, and infiltrating lymphocytes to infer patient-level characteristics.\n    A tissue slide can easily reach around 20GB in-memory, which turns intractable many approaches of feeding those slides entirely to a classifier. One recent method for addressing this problem is sampling regions based on low-resolution features (i.e. texture, boundaries) for extracting information about the tissue. Moreover, this method can also help with speeding up the processing, since after cropping the proposed regions, the problem would be turned into a tractable learning problem.",

With this project I propose to improve curve editing by adding features that currently require the curve to be converted to mesh, or cannot be performed at all. I will also improve the documentation of the code related to curve editing (by editing documentation and by improving the comments on the code).",

Thus we require some programmatic method to heal meshes which are defective. There are quite a few features already present to heal meshes, but these are not sufficient. Hence, the project. Existing features include: removal of unused and exactly duplicate vertices, dangling edges, decimation of edges, and fusing of equivalent faces. The features that will added are: checking manifold connectivity, removal of gaps, T - joints, overlaps, large holes, and degenerate triangles.",

So for the purpose of solid modeling, it is commonly impractical to represent these thin solids exactly as bounded volume, thus an available approach is to assign an implicit thickness to each face and then we can consider the thickness as a face property. Simply speaking, when shooting a ray towards the B-rep model, we can get ‘in’ and ‘out’ hit point from a face while the ‘out’ hit point is a small offset from the ‘in’ one with given thickness value along the ray direction.",

In contrast to Scratch, Catrobat is a visual programming language tailor-made for mobile devices, like smartphones and tablets.This project is intended to improve the user experience of the conversion process. The main points of these improvements refer to replacing the web interface with a native UI (directly integrated into Pocket Code's Android app) and implementing a WebSocket client that communicates with a central web service. In addition to that, users can search for Scratch programs inside the app and select programs they would like to convert. Those Scratch programs are then converted by the server into Pocket Code programs that can be executed on their mobile device. On the server-side, the web service should act as a central hub for any kind of client applications being planned in the future. Thus, server-related preparations and improvements have to be made as well.",

The project starts from downloading human proteins in all isoforms from ensembl and blast them against all PDB sequences. The alignments will be parsed and stored into carefully designed databases. A JSON based API will be built upon the database via predefined methods in database query, and cBioPortal obtained the alignments from the exposed API. A pipeline will also be constructed to update the alignments weekly.

Currently, cBioPortal has a multitude of information on DNA and RNA, but their information on protein levels derives from protein arrays, a technology that has severe limitations relative to mass spectrometry. Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) has performed mass spectrometry on the patient samples for TCGA tumors and it also includes information on post-translational modifications. I propose to integrate this information with the cBioPortal visualization interface. This involves extending their database with protein abundances and PTMs based on the CPTAC data and updating the cBioPortal interface with a new tab for post-translational modifications and updating existing tabs to accommodate the new protein data. By providing this upgrade, a tool that helps both scientists and doctors see personal and population biology at a glance will gain a new dimension.",

For highly inflected languages like Latin and Greek, the task is particularly important for two reasons: 1. words often have a dozen or more possible forms (and, as opposed to go in English, this is the norm and not only a characteristic of irregularly formed words), and 2. small corpus size in general often demands that counts for a given feature like words be based on the broadest measure possible. Currently available Latin lemmatizers rely largely on dictionary-based look up methods, which is a good solution for frequently occurring and unambiguous forms. For my Google Summer of Code project, I propose to rewrite the CLTK Latin and Greek lemmatizers to handle a higher percentage of forms by applying a backoff tagging approach.",

In recent years, discrete dynamic modeling has emerged as a powerful method of modeling and understanding biological systems. One type, boolean network models (which was initially used as a prototypical model of genetic regulatory networks), has been shown to be a tractable approach for modeling large-systems. A boolean network consists of a set of nodes whose state is binary and is determined only by other nodes in the network through Boolean functions. The simplicity and self-containment of these graphs makes it extremely fast to simulate these systems and is also a very realistic interpretation of how biological networks actually work. Unfortunately, no libraries yet exist for converting a visualization of a biological network into a logic gate visualization and vice-versa.Thus, the aim of this GSoC project is to develop a web-based tool that can visualize biological networks, and also transform these networks into a logic gate-based system.",

The customer can control his electrical consumers\nregarding the given information. Colibri with the OpenADR connection helps to automate this\nprocess on the customer side. The Colibri control module can reduce or increase the total power\nconsumption depending on to the information from the other smart grid agents. In the end this\nwill result in a more stable grid, because the energy producer and consumer will stand in an\ninterdependency.

Debian Stretch, the next Debian stable release, comprises 850 million lines of software source code. Code written in the C programming language accounts for 41% of the lines, which is more than in any other programming language. Debile, Debian’s package analysis platform, so far includes the CppCheck, Clang Static Analyzer, and Coccinelle tools for packages with C, C++, and Objective-C code. However, all of the tools perform static analyses, which can result in false positives. Too many reported false positives hinder adoption of the tools. To address this issue, I propose to integrate the KLEE tool into Debile. KLEE performs dynamic analysis on C programs and reports only true positives, i.e. real bugs. It does so by systematically exploring as many as possible execution paths in a given program. Errors that KLEE reports exist only along feasible execution paths, i.e. they correspond to real bugs in the program.",

With its in-build bots it can provide live assistance to users, suggest the best apps available for his needs, get latest releases and news, which can improve user experience a lot.Benefits to Debian: Will help to provide automated help to its users (by the bot) as well as ask new queries, report bugs etc, thus bridging the gap between a normal user and Debian system.Why Debian?: Well, Once you start exploring her, your curiosity never ends. Of all the other distros I have used, I learned more on Linux by using Debian. She is simple, minimalist and is highly educative in a learn by doing approach.",

Thus, the central part of the DUNE project are the interface classes that describe a wide range of domain tessellations.In order to ensure efficiency in scientific computations and support high-performance computing applications, a lot of static polymorphism is used in these interface classes, through function inlining and C++ templates. Consequently, using DUNE can be quite difficult for everyone: beginners have to acquire detailed C++ knowledge and even advanced users are limited in their productivity due to some subtleties.The project idea aims to provide Python bindings of the interface classes to make DUNE more useable. In fact, it would give the possibility to use Python for testing the underlying C++ classes, enable rapid prototyping and implementing new grids would be more easier for developers. Users who do not have or want detailed C++ knowledge could then use DUNE to solve partial differential equation in Python, using the bindings.",

The wire level regression test suite will exercise various states in the TCP/IP protocol suite, with both IPv4 and IPv6 support. Once integrated, the tool will also facilitate further development of such tests. The regression testing tool of choice here is Packetdrill.

Today we often know multiple variants of a particular DNA sequence. The differences between the individual sequences are called polymorphisms and can range in size from variations of a single base pair (single nucleotide polymorphism = SNP) to variations involving long stretches of DNA.There are a number of approaches (and file formats) for formally encoding variants of genomic sequences and their relationships in the form of graphs. Unfortunately it is often difficult to visualise these graphs in a way which conveys the complex information yet is intuitively easy to understand. The goal of this project is to help in the visualisation of genomic sequences and their variations by providing a JavaScript module which generates visual representations of genomic sequence graphs.

Also, it lacks a filter to specify the date-time (timestamp) range of the journal between which the user would like to see the logs.So, for this purpose, a search popover will be added besides the search entry where the user can select the journal field and the journal timestamp range filters. The user will also be able to enter a custom journal timestamp range in a submenu in the search popover. The search popover will also support an option to match the exact string or match in any part of the entered string.A search provider will be implemented for GNOME Logs to expose the search results to GNOME Shell using a shell search provider D-Bus API. The user can see the logs related to the entered search term in the GNOME Shell overview using this functionality.When the user clicks on a search provider result, a new window will open showing the details of the selected log.",

Since this project aims towards improving the overall user experience for both new and accustomed users, contextual popups, enhanced nickname   tab-completion, favorite users section contained in the user list and the clever filtering of their status messages would definitely prove to be valuable assets for the future versions of Polari.With the help of Florian Muellner and Bastian Ilso, whom will aid me as mentors in the process of developing these ideas, I plan on adding user-friendly features that would enhance the user onboarding capabilities of Polari, making it easier for people to use our application.",

Also,\nsince dealing with archives is actually dealing with files, the user will be able to do\nthis from the file manager.From the developer’s perspective, moving archive support to a library will\nallow for compression and decompression to be handled internally by applications.\nThis aims to reduce the usage of file-roller so it can eventually be removed as an\napplication.",

The solution for this lies in the recently drafted IETF ARC (Authenticated Received Chain) protocol. From Mailman's point of view, ARC is a protocol that can help mitigate denial of service to subscribed addresses at Yahoo!, AOL, and other sites that have a p = reject DMARC policy. With Google too set to migrate to a DMARC p=reject policy in the near future, the importance of the ARC protocol has become more significant.Basically, setting up ARC would allow Mailman to securely register its handling of the message, thus allowing the set-up of a trust mechanism between Mailman and the involved MTAs and hence reducing the denial of service.",

The music is first written in a text format; Lilypond then processes the file to output a graphical representation.Due to limitations in Lilypond's input syntax, one class of notational devices, spanners (e.g. slurs), are implemented with the assumption that they must start and end in the same voice. However, it is often desirable to have spanners start and end in different voices; in fact, any music that involves multiple simultaneous voices may use such notation.Presently, getting Lilypond to produce spanners between voices is not impossible, but requires an awkward workaround using a hidden voice. Although this works, it requires users to artificially add \"music\" that isn't actually there to compensate for a limitation of Lilypond. This project aims to develop a semantically clear and less confusing method of inputting cross-voice spanners.",

In most situations, all mentioned apps share similar/common metadata, which means that same information is duplicated in several places. Even more, in some cases app needs an access to data of another app (for example dashboard app can perform analysis of data stored in event capture application).\nThe aim of this project is to make all of the above mentioned apps share a common (shared) database. Instead of having one database per each app, one app will be implemented with shared database which will store and sync data to the server, while other apps will play a role of clients with UI part only.",

As part of the GSOC 2016, I propose to develop user profile application for DHIS2. This app will essentially provide a user interface to DHIS2 users to -I will be using ReactJS view library and will follow a Flux based architecture to write this app. The application's architecture should be such that we can reuse most of its components in other apps using D2-UI. It is important that the overall look and feel of this app matches that of the other new client-side applications. D2 should be extended by adding methods and properties so that it is capable of performing all operations required to view and update user profile and account settings.",

Speech is a dynamic process without clearly distinguished parts. It's always useful to get a sound editor and look into the recording of the speech and listen to it.\nAll modern descriptions of speech are to some degree probabilistic. That means that there are no certain boundaries between units, or between words. Speech to text translation and other applications of speech are never 100% correct. That idea is rather unusual for software developers, who usually work with deterministic systems.

As a result, most of the single cell and neural network models have low RAPT (reproducibility, accessibility, portability and transparency). This has slowed the progress of using biophysically and anatomically detailed neural network models in understanding the brain function in health and disease. In a period of three months during the GSoC placement, I would like to contribute to the Open Source Brain (OSB) Initiative which aims to increase the RAPT of single cell and neural network models. The project will extend the initial work by the OSB on converting the thalamocortical network model by Traub et al. (2005) to the simulator-independent model format, NeuroML2. Firstly, I propose to annotate and implement the tests for spiking behaviour of Traub model cells which are converted to the NeuroML2 format. Secondly, I propose to create a generic Python-based package which can generate different configurations of cortical networks in the NeuroML2 format  and combine unique network components from different cortical network projects.",

This is a computationally expensive method for exploring parameter space which limits the effectiveness of the program overall.This project represents an effort to update the Parameter Space Exploration (PSE) tool so that it can be used effectively for exploring the parameter space associated with each included large-scale brain model.

The path constraints are then put into canonical form and analyzed. Level of refinement of the path constraints dictate the level at which we model programs i.e. If we do not refine the path constraints at all, the program is modeled on a syntactical level. If we stop refinement early, the program is modeled on a semantic level but syntactical structure of the program is still considered. If we  completely refine the path constraints and put them into canonical form, the program is modeled on a semantic level with no consideration towards the syntactical structure of the program. This gives us options on applications of fingerprinting for programs. Further research in this field could result in semantic patterns not just being observed but rather analyzed.

We plan to create an Android app that includes all sources of jpf-core, with necessary modifications, wrapped in the user interface (UI).

The evaluation part of the current PSYCO implementation shows that the choice of k heavily influences the runtime behavior of PSYCO. Further it is argued, that it is possible to choose k to a relative small value after a manual analysis of the source code. During my project I will implement a symbolic search on the symbolic transition system produced by JDART to generate possible good choices for k in an automated manner.

The nodes on the trees are labeled as: OK if the method was regularly exited, ERROR if there was an exception, or DONT_KNOW if no valuation could be generated for the respective path.Currently, the constraints tree is represented only as a plain text file which makes identifying the nodes and the statuses of leaves extremely hard in such a simplistic representation. To provide a better user experience, I will develop a web interface to visualize the constraints trees generated by JDart. At a very basic level, a user will have an intuitive overview on the whole generated trees. At a later stage, I will enable interactive operations on the web interface, e.g. letting user select on which part of a tree JDart should focus on.",

It brings significant benefits comparing to normal SQL for search-related uses cases. Its full-text index can be updated in two ways: Automatically, whenever data changes (using listeners hooked into Hibernate) or by means of the \"mass indexe\", which rebuilds the entire index for given entity types.This proposal aims to provide an alternative to  the current mass indexer, based on the Java Batch architecture as defined by JSR 352. This standardized tool JSR 352 provides task-and-chunk oriented processing, parallel execution and many other optimization features.

Using git means that developers write commit messages. Nice and clean commit messages that adhere to an agreed-upon style are very common. So, implementing a way to validate these messages, like the commitplease project, makes a lot of sense. Currently, the commitplease project supports the jQuery style commit messages. Extending its support to the Angular-style ones (and possibly others) is a logical goal.",

                    "content": "Selecting multiple files in any file manager for copying and pasting has never been a pleasant experience, especially if the files are in a non-continuous order. Often, when selecting files using Ctrl+A or the selection tool, we find that we need to select only a subset of the required files we have selected. This leads to the unwieldy operation of removing files from our selection. Of course, the common workaround is to create a new folder and to put all the items in this folder prior to copying, but this is a very inefficient and very slow process if large files need to be copied. Moreover Ctrl+Click requires fine motor skills to not lose the entire selection of files.This is an original project with a novel solution to this problem. My solution is to add a virtual folder in all KIO applications, where the links to files and folders can be temporarily saved. The files and folders are \"staged\" on this virtual folder. Files can be added to this by using all the regular file management operations such as Move, Copy and Paste, or by drag and drop. Hence, complex file operations such as moving files across many devices can be made easy by staging the operation before performing it.",

In order to make the vector OSM theme complete and end - user ready, support for medium and lower tile levels must be added.For supporting low level rendering( levels 1, 3, 5, 7, 9), Marble should render using the Natural Earth vector dataset instead of the OSM vector dataset. The reason for this is that Natural Earth dataset has categorically arranged data which is required for step by step rendering of lower levels. Apart from this the rendered data should be styled so as to match the OSM theme and tiling support must be added on the server and client side.For the medium level tiles, rendering must be performed using the OSM dataset. OSM dataset gives us many small chunks and nodes for a particular geographic data item. These chunks and nodes need to be filtered and reduced to a manageable size for each specific level so as to get optimal performance and less screen clutter.Rendering of higher level tiles can be improved by adding rendering support for roof-types and textures tags of buildings.",

As it is, when you write code on their website and press submit, the code is sent to their server, compiled and the result is sent back. The problem with this, is that it doesn't show the entire capabilities of the language. For instance if you write a program that prints a message every second for 10 seconds, it will return that message printed ten times in an instant. What I want to do by using Emscripten is to have a real time tutorial, so that after the server sends back the result, it will actually print the message every one second, for ten seconds. I will also want to create a second tutorial that implements SDL as well. SDL is a language that can create shapes and interacts with keyboard inputs and the mouse. There already is compatibility between Ceu and SDL and there is also compatibility between SDL and Emscripten. The challenge is to create a synergy with all three languages. I believe this to be feasible, because you can transform a Ceu program into a C program that can then be compiled with Emscripten.",

This leads to different text rendering across different platforms and even across different versions of a particular OS due to changes in API implementation etc. This is the major issue this project addresses along with a host of other critical text layout issues.At the end of this project, LibreOffice will have a single text layout code path.

The conditions in the where clause of such a query that depend only on the columns of non-mergable view/derived tables are pushed into the query defining this view/derived table. This project will cover simple cases with pushing separable condition as well as more complicated cases with pushing non-separable conditions. It will resolve the problem of extracting pushable conditions by using equality predicates. It also will detect separable pushable conditions that can be extracted by using the basic properties of comparison predicates.",

By developing three pieces of code for a model of an important microbial metabolism, dissimilatory sulfate reduction, we can meet the interests of MSI researchers from all walks.

This feature can boost the memory management in App inventor by assigning memory when needed. \nThe proposal also marks the enhancement of file access. The app inventor currently doesn't support the access of External Storage in general. The proposal focuses on adding this feature so that many apps such as file managers can be made. Now, app inventor need not call an intent to access a file.\nFinally the proposal focuses on adding animation properties to the components so that the user is able to give a \"Living\" feel to their application.",

There are now two\nmain controller types: MIDI and HID. This project is about developing the third one: keyboard.The keyboard controller will be always visible in preferences -> controllers. In contrast to the HID- and the MIDI controllers, which both have four tabs (Controller Setup, Input Mappings, Output Mappings and Scripts), the keyboard controller will just have two tabs: Controller Setup and Key Mapping. The Controller Setup will be the same as for the HID controllers, but the Key mapping tab will consist of a table with three columns:Assigning key combinations will be as easy as clicking the key (combination) cell and pressing the desired key (combination).

The default search server is Apache Solr.Search platforms like Apache Solr and ElasticSearch index the data entities to be searched in a NoSQL schema format and provide much higher performance while performing search queries as compared to querying database when it comes to scalability. They store the fields of an indexed document using Trie data structures in accordance with some key attributes configured in their schema files.The components which are to be covered are:",

Cytoscape includes the commandTool app to provide a command-line interface to Cytoscape using the Commands API. Cytoscape apps can register commands using annotations, and these commands will then be available in commandTool.

The package RCy3  allows users to connect R to Cytoscape allowing them to script their visualizations. There are two ways the package would be enhanced: 1) by enabling the use of Cytoscape plugins programmatically through their API, and  2) by creating robust walkthroughs of the code necessary to use RCy3 and other packages for reproducible network visualizations.

This project will have many sub-projects in it with their individual deadlines and milestones, at the same time many bugs also will be corrected by me, as there can be many number of bugs I will maintain a list of bugs where they will be prioritized with the help and recommendation of mentor and community. Few of the sub-projects which are either enhancement or new feature have been mentioned in the project proposal while some of them will come on the way of this three month of coding period so depending upon their urgency, need and complexity I will take up them with an appropriate deadline assigned by mentor.",

Since smaller problems are fed to the solver (eg.

RiPPs can be divided in more than 20 sub-classes and have a wide range of biological functions:  among others, they can work as antibiotics, nutritional additives or food preservatives. Thus, the use of RiPPs as drugs is increasing and several RiPP derivatives are already in advanced phases of clinical trials.\nIn this project, prediction modules for a number of RiPP clusters will be developed. Working together with the mentors, who can provide technical and scientific advice, antiSMASH plug-ins will be created to allow researchers to identify the RiPP precursor gene, identify the cleavage sites of the core peptide and predict further modifications to its sctructure. With these plug-ins, we hope to accelerate all the research involving RiPPs and consequently, shorten the time “between the bench and the bed” for possible new drugs.",

By now, there are many more tracking devices (HTDs) around, and many of them offer their APIs. By exploiting these services, openSNP can dramatically increase the amount of QS data available in the public domain, providing a means for academic researchers and scientists to find new associations.

The project aims to extend the Chemical JSON format with the different data points that cclib can parse, and have cclib pass this extended Chemical JSON to Avogadro-2 via a simple command call. To display the information being provided by the Chemical JSON, the functionality to read and render specific data points will have to be implemented in Avogadro-2. \nThis abstraction of restricting the data exchange to Chemical JSON greatly limits the dependency of Avogadro-2 on cclib. In the future, this interface can be extended by another data parsing library to provide information in a standard format (i.e. Chemical JSON); building upon the powerful plugin architecture on which Avogadro-2 is designed upon.",

Identifying the spacegroup of a crystal, converting a crystal to a conventional or primitive cell, symmetrizing a crystal, and filling a unit cell are all important features that crystallographers need when working with crystals. Thus, while being careful to avoid licensing issues with external libraries, my primary goal is to advance the materials applications in Avogadro 2 by first incorporating these features that were present in Avogadro 1 and then eventually incorporating new features that can be useful for crystallographers.",

An open communication protocol needs to be defined for this and also special programable processors that can generate feedback signals and control Cyclops (via the protocol).\nAfter configuring the processors in the pipeline, the GUI would program Cyclops and the experiment can be launched.In addition to this, a more powerful and upgraded Cyclops that uses a Teensy board will be released.

Achieving reactive and adaptive path planning may require extensions to several parts of ROS and ROS-Industrial, including the MoveIt! or Descartes path planners, the ROS control layer, or the Simple Message protocol to hardware robot controllers. Development can take place without actual force sensors or cameras, using simulated sources of the high-level outputs of these sensors in terms of small adjustments that affect the trajectories.

In the latter approach, a single model is fitted to each object allowing one to determine, with subpixel precision, their position, amplitude, and width.However, this becomes a non straightforward task when considering fitting multiple overlapping objects. To do so, one can not “just fit a model with hundreds parameters”. In fact, there exist several problems with this “brute force” approach, and the most critical one might be that the parameter space will have many dimensions (as many as the number of parameters, precisely), which almost certainly will make optimization algorithms to diverge or to get stuck in a local minima.Hence, my primary task is to work on developing an algorithm to localize, fit, and perform photometry of several overlapping objects (e.g. a dense star cluster, globular clusters, etc) simultaneously.",

By using observed elemental abundances and these ionization states, one can use CHIANTI to obtain synthetic spectra of solar plasma from various features, which inform a response function used by the observational instruments themselves. This response function is vital to understanding observations. The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) is a multi-wavelength imager on the Solar Dynamics Observatory that specifically looks at the solar corona to understand magnetic processes.  This project aims to use SunPy to infer plasma properties like temperature and density by developing the routines necessary to calculate two response functions for the AIA using Python and ChiantiPy. They are wavelength response functions that calculate the amount of flux per wavelength as measured by AIA, and temperature response functions that calculate the sensitivity of light from the plasma per temperature as measured by AIA.",

At present day CNN has been successfully applied in various fields of Computer Vision, for example: image classification [1, 2, 3], semantic segmentation [4], object detection [5], human pose estimation [6], etc. \nAlso some of the recent researches have tried to apply discriminating power of CNN for visual tracking purposes: [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Almost all of them outperform state-of-art tracking algorithms (like TLD [12], KCF [13]) in terms of accuracy, but lose in terms of speed.\nOne of the most recent successful trackers based on CNN are MDNet and GOTURN. Though MDNet has been evaluated as a top – accuracy tracker (1-st place on VOT2015), it suffers from low performance (~1 FPS) due to CNN online learning. While GOTURN can run on around 100 FPS maintaining high accuracy and robustness (close to MDNet). Good speed/accuracy tradeoff makes GOTURN one of the most promising next-generation trackers. So this proposal aims to implement GOTURN tracker in OpenCV library.",

Among all the available algorithms, phase-shifting profilometry (PSP) is one of the most popular and I believe OpenCV would benefit from its implementation. Unfortunately, PSP does not perform well on dynamic scenes since it belongs to time-multiplexing methods. Indeed, successive patterns are not deformed in the same way which leads to reconstruction errors. To reduce reconstruction errors due to motion, scientists had the idea to combine PSP with Fourier transform profilometry (FTP), a one-shot method that uses the same patterns. My goal for GSoC 2016 is to add PSP, FTP and Fourier assisted phase-shifting profilometry (FAPS) to OpenCV.  Spatial phase unwrapping, which is essential to PSP, FTP and FAPS, will be coded as an independent module due to its broad number of applications. Finally, as a proof of concept of scene understanding from structured light, an automatic piecewise-planar surfaces detection will be tested on the results provided by Fourier transform profilometry.",

Furthermore, it will elaborate criteria of route correctness and validate the existing routes against those criteria. There are Python scripts written by Polyglot to find ways that belong to a route described by its stops and to compare a given route to an already existing route. However, their installation requires additional steps, so for a better usability an extended version of this functionality needs to be implemented as part of the JOSM public transport plugin.",

The goal is not to substitute QGIS Cart Comp or similar, it's just about completing all features so the cartography scripting abilities of GRASS GIS and its potential can be fully used.GRASS GIS contains some modules which would be good to implement into cartography suite for wxGUI Map Display. There are d.barscale, d.graph, d.histogram, d.legend and many other d.* commands to use. There are bugs in some of them and it needs to be fixed(options for map window size). Then there are some modules which need to be enhanced. Legend background is currently transparent -> add an options for opacity, border and corner settings. It's possible to set number of breaks/ticks for legend but values are not rounded -> add an option for manual brakes/ticks, add an option for automatic breaks/ticks (every ten, hundred)",

This project aims to solve this issue by providing simple tools to create expressive GIFs by writing small scripts. The scripting language provides means to describe technical animations by typing code, instead of relying on click-and-drag interfaces of most design programs, which is in fact more practical when the animation we intend to create involves objects describable mathematically or programmatically.\nThe core tool will thus be a small program which takes a script written by the user and outputs the GIF animation described in the script.",

Ruby is not efficient but simplifies the compiler for its high-level features including dynamic typing and reflection.  The end-product of this project will be an ideal tool that can be used by students and researchers to understand compilation techniques for functional logic programming languages, and to experiment with and prototype specific aspects of the language and the compiler, in particular parallelism, security, optimizations and language extensions.",

Unlike WAH which has a constant compression length, VAL (Variable-Aligned Length) compression varies depending on the column being compressed. By allowing different compression lengths, VAL can anticipate noisier columns and can compress them more efficiently than WAH can.VAL currently only exists coded in Java and can be optimized if extended into C. Then, if run in parallel, VAL would yield even greater benefits. Over the course of the summer, I intend to implement VAL in C and allow for parallelized compression and querying as well to demonstrate the benefits of VAL.",

With Pandas readily available for most users, this is tedious fait accompli for users, since the core data model for PySAL's API was designed before Pandas existed. While newer projects have attempted to extend Pandas for geographic data, those packages have difficult-to-install dependencies that make them inaccessible for many end users, and make design decisions which the author thinks are somewhat suboptimal for PySAL's use case. Therefore, I propose to specify and implement a tabular spatial data model in Python leveraging Pandas dataframes directly, rather than through subclassing. This follows in the spatialite idea that spatial data is first data, then spatial. Thus, tooling must focus on enabling spatial operations directly on Pandas dataframes by exploiting column dtype information and dispatching appropriately, instead of a subclassing approach. In the end, this project would result in a simpler data model for PySAL.",

Along with an accurate implementation of L-PCA and its adaptation to Rician noise, the project will also aim at optimising the implementation of L-PCA using Cython. \nAfter implementing L-PCA, a method for robust brain extraction needs to be developed. DIPY’s median OTSU based implementation is known not work so well with non-echo planar diffusion imaging (non-EPI dMRI) data. There are few possible ways to improve this, one is to generate labels and have weighted median OTSU. Another idea involves using some version of patch based segmentation using image library constructed from previously annotated images and using it as a reference for the subsequent extraction.",

Umbrella Sampling (US) is an MD technique which involves performing a series of simulations in which a ‘reaction coordinate’ – such as distance between two molecules – is restrained to different values. Simulation data can be combined, usually using the WHAM method, to produce a ‘potential of mean force’ (PMF) profile that shows the energy landscape along the chosen coordinate. Several implementations of WHAM exist, but require input files of specific formats which may differ from that obtained directly from the simulation, dependent on the simulation engine used. Additionally, it would be convenient be able to calculate the PMF alongside analysis of the trajectory such as offered by MDAnalyisis. However, MDAnalysis does not yet have tools specifically for dealing with and analysing US simulations. This project aims to introduce capabilities for loading US simulation sets, including a generalised tool for loading auxiliary data files, and performing WHAM and other basic analysis.",

Implementing coroutines will be the main feature of this project, as this feature offers more new methods than the other features. PEP 465 shows that Matrix multiplication is already used more often than bitwise operations in numeric libraries. Also, having coroutines with async and await syntax as well as enhanced unpacking options, the possibility that Python 3.5 syntax will be used in upcoming code rises. Therefore, an implementation of these features in PyPy3 will definitely increase compatibility to future Python 3 programs.

The Sockets API allows N:1 communication and differentiates between block and stream protocols. In addition, programs that already use sockets can easily transition to the virtio-vsock device without major changes in their code.However, the traffic sent through virtio-vsock is hidden to the outside world, as it is internally performed between the hypervisor and the driver.

Postcopy migration is used for virtual machines which have a high memory dirtying rate, (higher than the bandwidth of the network that will be used to perform migration). The disadvantage of postcopy migration is, if there is a network failure then we are left with an inconsistent vm at both the source and the destination side.\nThe aim of this project is to recover from the network failure, and complete the migration process. The project will include completing the process of sending the leftover memory pages.\nProject would start by making sure that the threads do not fail at both the source and destination end. This would be followed by re-establishing the network connection between the source and the destination. After this is done, the migration process is restarted. The vCPUs on the destination side were suspended due to page faults, so these pages are transferred first. Followed by the rest of the leftover pages on the source side.",

However, many hyperspectral imaging platforms have low resolution (>5m per pixel) causing each pixel to be a mixture of several materials. The process of unmixing one of these 'mixed' pixels is called hyperspectral image unmixing or simply hyperspectral unmixing.\nThere is an R package for this purposes however, the already implemented methods N-FINDR and VCA make one crucial assumption: they assume the presence of pure spectra of all components are available somewhere in the data. Obviously, while this assumption is reasonable for some applications, other applications exist where this assumption should not be relied on.

It is common to implement optimized data structures when working in C, but it should not impose users of the high level languages like Ruby to the task of implementing optimized data structures by themselves. However, it is necessary to select appropriate data structures in order to achieve efficient access to the data structures.It seems possible to offer some implementations per data structure in Ruby, and select it implicitly in order to offer desirable performance without difficulty to the users.For example, List is a basic structure for programmers, but Ruby does not offer it. Instead, Ruby programmers use Array. In fact, Array offers List like methods such as insert, delete, push back and more. Hence, it is easy to use, but the performance of these methods like insert and delete are not executed at a constant time, while they in List run at a constant time.\n(Similar ideas would be possible on String and Hash.)",

The topic is complex: a Ruby tightly corseted by types would not be true to the essence of the language.Under a gradual typing discipline, type annotations can be specified at will: interesting parts of the program can be given explicit types and their type safety checked statically. We propose an implementation of gradual typing in Matz's Ruby Interpreter, drawing inspiration from similar additions to other dynamic languages, with strictly optional type annotations consistent with Ruby's DRY and \"lazy\" philosophy and an evaluation of the practical usefulness of gradual typing.",

We say two self-maps of projective space are equivalent if there is an element of the Projective Linear Group that conjugates one to the other. The following two algorithms should be implemented, in order to create more functionality in moduli space.\nThe first algorithm would be that given two endomorphisms of projective space determine if they are conjugate. In other words, determine if they are in the same class in the moduli space. If they are, also return the PGL element that conjugates one to the other.The second algorithm would be that given an endomorphism of projective space to compute a reduced form. This conjugation would that makes the coefficients small. There is already an algorithm implemented to return the minimal model in terms of resultant, but the coefficients can be non-optimal. The simplest approach would be to reduce the binary form describing the fixed points or if the binary form describing the fixed points is not sufficiently nice then reduce the binary form for points of period n for some small n.",

Then the existing compilation pipeline can be reused to produce JavaScript code from the IR. The key to this project is that, as complex as it may be, it would reuse a lot of great code. Reusing an existing Java parser and typechecker as well as the whole JavaScript generation framework will allow me to focus on converting the AST into IR efficiently and covering as many Java constructs as possible.",

As the amount of data becomes extreme large, normal computing methods cannot handle such a volume. Running Big Data on Spark ecosystems might be a reasonable way. Its capability to compute data at large scale give us a good solution. However, most of data are unlabeled data; and labeling data not only means highly cost but also requires expertise in that domain.  That is to say, using Supervised Learning algorithms might be unreasonable. In addition, Semi-supervised learning might not be a good way too as for its assumptions need some particular data distributions. Unsupervised Learning (Clustering-based) is a good start step towards this problem. \n       Thus, in this project, I am trying to solve this problem by two phases: retrieving data from Elasticsearch-Hadoop; building a statistical analysis tool on Spark streaming computing from a clustering perspective.

Recently, there has been a lot of development around the solveset to replace solve. The major issues with merging solveset with solve are that the lack of solvers for univariate Transcendental Equations and Multivariate equations.

Then for returning solution, Set are the simplest and most intuitive way. Like in real pen-paper exam, we are supposed to return solutions in form of sets.

To address this issue, PowerUp uses Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) to empower middle school girls to take ownership of their health and sexual activity. The proposal is to create a mobile application that will incorporate quality and relevant information surrounding self-esteem and reproductive health, and will offer interactive activities to help concertize corresponding concepts through a choose-your-own-adventure game that puts preadolescent girls in the driver’s seat, making their own decisions to learn about reproductive health and self-esteem.",

The way CG is currently combined with the tagger works reasonably well empirically but is actually somewhat unsound in terms of the theory of operation of the tagger (words are identified by different ambiguity classes during training and tagging). For my first task, I will implement new ways of combining them both during in tagging and during tagger training .For my second task I will implement an averaged perception POS tagger based on the one in the Python module nltk. This will have some level of configurability in terms of word features (ie can choose to look at suffixes or prefixes of different lengths) to accommodate different types of languages. Another requirement will be to work (not necessarily very well) with little or no configuration (which means eventually not using the coarse tags of the other taggers).",

This project is using the existing Apertium’s Spanish dictionary in order to build a package with two monolingual dictionaries for Spanish and Sicilian languages and a bilingual package for Spanish-Sicilian equivalents and translation rules.So, the project flow is the following:As a result, the final coverage of monolingual Sicilian package must be more than 90% of Sicilian Wikipedia corpus, and the evaluation on the parallel corpus must be error-free. First of all, this Sicilian dictionary has good prospects to become a base for new Apertium language pairs. Second,  automatic translation based on the developed package could be useful for Wikipedia users: Apertium's machine translation for Sicilian could help to translate more articles for the growing Sicilian Wikipedia.",

DRAKVUF is an open source malware analysis framework running on top of the Xen hypervisor. By using Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) techniques, DRAKVUF is able to transparently monitor and control the state of a virtual machine from a level beyond the OS.

LLVM provides a variety of analyses and transformation capabilities that are leveraged to optimize programs and facilitate efficient execution. More recently, LLVM was enhanced by a new optimization framework, namely Polly, that supports automatic parallelization and data-locality optimizations based on the polyhedral model. Polly is able to speed up compute kernels significantly, especially in the context of dense linear algebra and iterative stencil computations.

Such solvers are important because they are especially suited for solving stiff ODEs, which are very common. In light of this, the first goal of my proposed project is a native implementation of implicit solvers RADAU and MEBDFI. Further, in order to reliably use ODE.jl, a robust initial value problem (IVP) testing suite for ODE.jl solvers is a necessity. Work has has been started towards this end through the development of IVPTestSuite.jl.

The second model is a combinatorial approach that involves matrix operations such multiplication and vector indexing on distributed sparse matrices. ParallelGraphs will enable users to process graphs using sequential algorithms on smaller graphs. This will be accomplished by providing compatibility with LightGraphs.jl. The package will also experiment will CPU/GPU parallel algorithms with an aim of unifying all graph computation models in a single package.",

APIs and data structures change over time but drivers should provide functionality in any case.This project aims to add support for Linux Kernel backports in already existing configuration option, localmodconfig.

The website will be similar to AmIUnique.org or Panopticlick for users where they will get a complete summary with statistics after the test suite has been executed. It can be used to test new fingerprinting protection as well as making sure that fingerprinting-related bugs were correctly fixed with specific regression tests.

For each such article, the bot aims to accomplish the following tasks:\n(1) Flag passages with facts and statistics which are likely to have become out of date and have not been updated in a given number of years\n(2) Flag phrases which are likely unclear\n(3) Flag bad student editsFlagged instances are then stored in a database and open to the reviewers for reviewing and closing the flags. A reviewer can decide to either 'Accept' or 'Dismiss' a review item as valid/invalid. Two reviewers decide the fate of each review item, and in the case of a conflict, it is sent to a third reviewer. Reviewer reputation scores are computed based on a mechanism of acceptability of reviews by other peer reviewers. Reviews which lowered the scores can be optionally displayed to the reviewers.",

There already exists a version of profiling view in qapitrace. It has only a limited set of old metrics and it might lack some usability features. This GUI project plans to add new metrics, as well as improving the interface overall.",
