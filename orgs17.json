Simple Features) is a common standard for exchanging spatial features that is widely used in geoinformatics in Open Source projects as well as in proprietary programs. It defines a generic data model for storing and accessing geographic data and their geometry types.Protocol Buffers is a format for data serialization which has inbuilt features such as binary serialization, RPC frameworks and IDL. Its unique features such as flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for serializing structured data but with smaller, faster, and simpler manner makes it a very good candidate for ​ data serialization use cases.JTS Topology Suite (JTS), which is a free and open source library containing geometries that correspond to the Simple Feature Access Standard.Main goal of the project is to define and implement of a serialization API based on JTS, which transparently serializes geometries based on the Simple Feature specification using Protocol Buffers. Extending support for other serialization frameworks such as Avro and support for raster data will also be addressed based on time constraints.",

The proposed zookeeper module will minimize the manual configuration required when configuring OODT components. That is, this module will make use of the inherited configuration at component level. For example consider the file manager. Almost all the configurations of file manager instances are identical.

With that in mind, the number of light sources in a scene expands rapidly and requires a program to traverse the lights optimally when estimating their significance and impact for each scene point. As such, the many-light problem is introduced when calculating global illumination.There are different algorithms to compute the global illumination, but each of those algorithms needs to sample all the lights of the scene first, and then do the computations. Optimizing the light sampling algorithm leads to faster and more efficient use of rendering time with the same degree of image realism, which are the exact same reasons why improvement of many-light sampling in Appleseed is required.Within the proposal I've given an overview of the implementation approach of the new many-light sampling algorithm, split the overall problem into smaller pieces and tried to propose a realistic implementation timeline.",

Hereby, one of the most requested features in appleseed is Volume rendering. This term implies that the rendering engine takes into account how light interacts with media between the objects, and computes how it is absorbed and scattered by air, smoke or fog molecules, or by denser media such as milk or marble.My goal is to integrate the feature of rendering homogeneous volumes to appleseed engine, and thus making it capable to handle simple volumetric effects, such as light shafts in a foggy environment. During my work I will investigate different approaches of visualizing volumes, select the techniques that are modern, efficient and fit the best to the existing path tracing code of appleseed, and then implement the chosen methods. Additionally, I will introduce how users will interact with the newly added features by extending the user interface of appleseed.studio.",

Ardupilot rover version (APMRover2) is well behind Arduplane and ArduCopter in capabilities as they attract more attention from developers.  One obvious example is that Rover has only a very basic avoidance system (turn 45° on obstacle). It is also missing some autonomous features (on spot turn etc.), and more significantly is missing a proper motor configuration abstraction layer. While ArduCopter is capable of being configured in 4,6,8 motors copter with brushed (PWM) or brushless motor (RC PWM), the rover version is still limited to two modes: rover with propulsion and a steering servo (normal mode) and tank mode (skid steering mode), with only support on brushless motor.\nMy proposal to this GSOC is split in two parts. Firstly, reduce the gap between the APMRover2 and the other vehicles to provide a good generic UGV platform capable of multiple configurations, with advance feature such as avoidance.  Secondly,  provide a good set of tutorials on the usage of ROS and ardupilot either for single unit control or on simulated unit on Gazebo simulator!",

I believe that providing a programming-language-level abstraction layer is an effective approach to significantly reduce the amount of time focused on how systems can fail, rather than how they should work. Such an approach should mainly consist in supplying systems programmers with basic functionalities in the following areas: node distribution, data replication and partition tolerance.\nBeing in an early adoption stage, Lasp needs applications that can serve as proof of concept in order to increase awareness of its capabilities as well as user adoption.

If I find one widget that Cricket uses but isn't implemented on Toga, I will develop a contribution to this specific widget. This way the application will not lose the basics layout. So, the proposal will not only focus on the port of Tkinter to Toga, but on mapping the necessary widgets for a real application using Toga framework. In addition of the advantages of using Toga instead of Tkinter as I highlighted, this is a opportunity to improve error handling and make better use of features that Toga has but Tkinter does not.

SwellRT use operational transformations (OTs) to coordinate the insertion and deletion of characters in its documents, so instead of encrypting the entire document, we need to encrypt each operation and still guarantee that the server has enough information to coordinate the document editioning. Fortunately, it is a field that has been researched for many years and we have some studies that have successfully implemented E2EE in Google Docs. We can take their insights to encrypt SwellRT OTs.The project has two parts. First, we need to encrypt and decrypt successfully SwellRT OTs, using a symmetric key. Then, we need to communicate those symmetric keys among users, and here is where we need public key cryptography.",

Meanwhile, methods (such as SVM, nearest neighbor) can also be employed to prune the fetched articles to filter out those are irrelevant to our topic despite containing the exact words on the topic. Furthermore, due to the fact that articles may use different choices of words over time, time series analysis needs to be applied to keep track of the evolution of one topic during a certain period of time.

Gatekeeper is an open source defence against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. To protect server resources from an attack, it services requests based on priority: the higher its priority, the closer to the exit of the egress queue its placed. Additionally, it also limits the requests’ maximum link bandwidth occupancy to 5%. Such countermeasures are implemented through the priority queue data structure which holds all requests in a single priority queue dropping low-priority requests when resources are low. This functionality allows us to allocate as many resources as possible to high-priority requests while servicing low-priority requests only when resources are idle. The successful implementation of this project will essentially enable a regular Linux router to help isolate and protect legitimate traffic during DoS attacks by employing Gatekeeper’s priority queue as a kernel module, enabled by its userspace component in Linux's tc(8) utility.",

The input fields in the dialog box are further categorised and presented in the form of tabs. User can easily switch to any tab to see contained input fields, thus enriching the experience by keeping the natural flow of user.

I propose to create a global view of ctDNA information by modifying their existing Genomic Overview to display allele frequencies, allowing users to identify at a glance mutated genes of interest. Mutated genes can be tracked by clicking on the gene, which would display a plot of the gene’s mutation concentration over time. A heatmap of selected genes can also be generated to monitor tumor heterogeneity over time. Another feature could consist of plots to track whether a mutated gene produces a differential time to relapse or survival time compared to the unaltered gene. By visualizing ctDNA results on the cBioPortal interface, I can participate in adding an exciting new clinician tool for personalized cancer genomics.",

They split the input into chunks, and calculate the hash of each chunk using a simple (i.e. fast) hashing algorithm. What is important to note here is that the hash for the whole string is calculated incrementally, beginning from zero (or some known constant value), and for each chunk the checksum of the string including that chunk is calculated only using the old checksum (of the string without the new chunk) and the difference between the last chunk and the current one.Some useful rolling hash algorithms that could be employed are Fletcher’s checksum algorithms or the Adler-32 checksum.",

PRNGs take 1-5% of CPU time. PRNGs used must possess very large periods, fast execution, the ability to create a large number of streams, and very good correlation properties between streams and sampled values. It must be possible to reproduce a simulated event any time, for reexamination or debugging.\nThe transition from event-level parallelism in Geant4 to dynamical multithreading in GeantV requires associating the random generator states not with the threads but with the tracks, which are shuffled between \"baskets\" based on their type and energy.

For example, a number of Old French texts from the BNF's 19th century editions have been digitized and made available at gallica.fr. \nLemmas will be sourced from Godefroy's 1901 \"Lexique de l'Ancien Français\" and the \"Dictionnaire Electronique de Chrétien de Troyes\", which has the advantage of English-language definitions.",

This involves porting the individual modules and sub–modules piece by piece, where the whole process will be guided by unit tests. In the beginning, I will remove all tests from the pipeline that do not pass for Python 3 and take this pared–down code base as a starting point, porting parts of the code and putting the respective unit tests back in as I go along. Missing unit tests must be added before moving on. Since porting Python 2 code to Python 3 code is a standard problem for the Python community, there are many different tools available that can help in this regard.

A valuable pronunciation source is Wiktionary, which is a multilingual, web-based project to create a free content dictionary of all words in all languages. Although Wiktionary contains pronunciations for many words and multiple languages in a standard format like IPA, it’s not easy to parse those pronunciations from sources in different page formats and convert phonemes in different languages to one common format like CMUBET which can be used by Sphinx.

More recently, robust DNN-based speech recognition techniques have been developed that have been adopted by all major commercial systems including those from Google and Amazon. In such a setting, the GMM-HMM based speech recognition framework used by Sphinx is severely outdated and requires an upgrade to perform at par with the state-of-the-art systems.I propose a two-tiered approach for acoustic scoring that uses concepts from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Gate Recurrent Units (GRU) for acoustic modelling. The first level consists of convolutional filters and pooling layers that produce convolutional features from each audio frame. The second level consists of a single GRU-based DNN that estimates the output probabilities for each HMM. The optimal state sequence can then be found using Viterbi decoding. Over the course of the project this setup will be optimised by experimenting with different structural parameters for the DNNs as well as different learning techniques.",

The player has a crystal that allows them to switch gravity between the vectors (0, ,9.8, 0) and (0, -9.8, 0). This would be implemented using the soy.fields.Accelerate class. The player will progress through three levels, dodge enemies, and fight a final boss to win. The camera follows the player object by calculating the difference in the X values and each frame smoothly matching the camera’s X value to the player object.I’d like to really show off what the engine can do graphically. Specifically, I would like to use the soy.bodies.mesh object to show more complex models then shape primitives. I would also like to use the triplanar material class soy.materials.triplanar to add more detail through bump and glow maps. In addition, I am developing a Blender add-on to export 3-D models from Blender into the custom PySoy mesh format.",

Based on the response from these systems we need to query the DBpedia dataset using SPARQL and present the data back to the user in a meaningful way. Ideally, both the presentation and interaction flow needs to be tailored for the individual social network.I would like to stress that although the primary medium of interaction is text, platforms such as Facebook insist that a proper mix between chat and interactive elements such as images, buttons etc would lead to better user engagement.

It applies several inter-disciplinary NLP techniques to assign types to DBpedia entities. The primary goal of the project is to streamline and improve the approach which was proposed.

Also, for handling all of the network communications the Netty's NetClient should be used as it Vert.x do. Nativeness of the client means that state machine and implementation of behavior model should be written from the scratch.

The second part is a little scattered, including making a RPM package for Plinth and setting up a repo for it in Copr, testing inside a Virtual Machine, and modifying some configuration files and the documents for users to fit the changes of Plinth during this project, at the same time, a new wiki page for Plinth in Fedora is needed.",

It serves only to output a valid bitstream, with little concern about quality. This project aims to improve the general performance of the encoder, bringing it closer to a viable status. This will be done by integrating features of the existing AAC psychoacoustic model system within the native Vorbis encoder and adapting the FFmpeg Vorbis decoder to utilize that new information.

It was built by Maurice Wilkes and his team at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory. EDSAC is the world’s first stored-program computer.The project’s goal is to reimagine the EDSAC on modern hardware, with the ultimate objective to make the historic computer accessible to and reproducible by a new generation of computer architects and engineers. Investigating the evolution of computing techniques gives architects and engineers context to modern concepts of computer architecture, organisation and design.The historic computer, complete with all its subsystems, will be replicated on an FPGA, using Verilog HDL, capable of accepting and executing all EDSAC Orders. To emulate the ancient I/O, various “I/O flavours” will be designed to interface with the FPGA board, via a standardised communication protocol. Users can choose, extend and even add new I/O flavours. An assembler utility will be built in Python, which users can utilise to debug and build their code for EDSAC, which can be then loaded onto the FPGA for execution.",

However, when comes to benchmarking the prototyped platform at software-level, current runtime libraries and operating systems still have to be improved. To address this problem, the goal of this project is integrate OpenRISC Linux Port into OpTiMSoC. To do so, a new manycore configuration with a Host Tile will be designed and implemented. The Host Tile will run OpenRISC Linux and will be able to communicate with Gzll kernels running on Computing Tiles via message-passing through the Network-on-Chip (NoC).

This proves problematic in cases when direct testing of some newly installed or updated utility/library has to be performed.

HoloLens uses the real-world as a canvas on which to overlay virtual elements. \nThe prospective application will utilise the genetic data held by Ensembl, and bring genes and genomes to life by creating 3-D ‘holograms’ of them which viewers can interact with using natural gestures, voice commands, and eye movements. \nDepending on the success of the resulting application, there is scope to move the application to the Improbable Spatial OS platform (https://improbable.io/), which can be integrated with applications built with Unity. (Improbable is partnered with Google Cloud Platform to deliver their services). This platform allows developers to build simulations of virtual worlds in which concurrent players can interact.

The second plugin gives the user a sense of time, by drawing vertical lines each ten seconds (or other period of time). For example, it will be useful when the user zooms in and wants to move along the timeline, because Pitivi will display guidelines. Finally, the third one is a plugin that avoid the tedious process of dragging video (or image) clips over other video (or image) clips in order to create a transition when there are a very large set of this clips. This plugin will save time to users who just want to import a set of images (of last vacation trip for example) to create a video as fast as possible.",

Nevertheless the integration of the Nextcloud desktop client for file synchronization still has lot of room for improvement.By now the client demands that the user already has an account for a Nextcloud instance. Providing the setup wizard with a simple list of hosting providers will allow users to find a provider they trust and register an account from within the client.The integration with the GNOME desktop environment will be improved by extending the existing file context menu and file icon overlays. Furthermore basic integration the the cloud providers API proposed by Carlos Soriano will be added.Gnome as well as KDE both provide a simple single sign-on service that allows users to enter their\ncredentials for web services like Nextcloud (gnome-online-accounts and accounts-sso). The Nextcloud client should make use of the accounts created there as well as add accounts when setting them up in the client.",

The Todoist plugin inside To DO will make use of the todoist v7 API to make sync calls for process like loading tasks,lists or updating tasks etc. Todoist server responds to every request with a JSON response. The Todoist provider would check the JSON response for error and if correct process it to retrieve requested data.\nAt the end of the project we will have a working Todoist plugin which will be a nice addition to To Do.

For this reason, it is crucial to guarantee a certain high quality of service (QoS). This QoS may be degraded by the presence of spurious undesirable signals coming from jammers that could degrade partially (or totally) the bandwidth of the desired GNSS signal.\nBasically, two kinds of Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI) can disturb a GNSS signal. Each one has its own characteristic spectral feature and a classification based on that is described as following:\n•    Continuous wave interferences (CWI): a perturbation of a relative small part of the spectrum and can be mitigated by means of a notch filter.\n•    Short pulsed interferences: with an instantaneous bandwidth that usually covers the entire GNSS band and can be partially removed by means of a blanking filter. \nTwo interference detection and mitigation algorithms will be evaluated in order to implement a new Signal conditioner block into GNSS-SDR. These algorithms will be coded in C++",

In addition to that, various input widgets of QT framework are used to interact with the ongoing simulations. The QT framework constrains the input/output operations from the system running the simulation.In software development, the new paradigm is moving towards web based systems because of simple usability for the user and wide range of available frameworks for developers. In this project, an OOT module for web-based GUI is proposed for GNU Radio. The primary focus of the project will be a display mechanism which will be used to interact with ongoing simulation based on the parameters provided through interactive HTML inputs.In the proposal, the focus is on the flow of the final OOT module and implementation details. The details of minute tasks like the arrangement of plots & widgets inside the output, the color, and labeling of the plots etc. have been intentionally left out but will be implemented taking gr-qtgui module as a guideline.",

Individual entries in this matrix require an inner loop to compute current contributions to the compartment. It is a particularly interesting problem to optimize GPU computations for these neuron calculations, since there is a tradeoff between memory transfers and speed of individual GPU cores. \nOptimizing the GPU code will increase the speedup, when the no of computations are very large,  then even a small amount of speedup is very beneficial as it saves a lot of time, so optimizing the GPU code is important.",

The latter functionality will have major benefits for the speed with which large simulations in Brian can run.\nThis is because it allows the use of larger timesteps for the overhead loops in Python, without losing\n(likely even improving) the accuracy of the numerical integration at points where small timesteps\nare necessary.

However, bottleneck exists in terms of how much data can be transferred between hard disk and memory for computation  [1]. As research increasingly relies on processing huge volumes of data, this issue demands attention. One strategy which addresses this is memory compression of data in memory (DRAM). Algorithms that are effective do a good job of decompressing exactly as much of the data as are needed for the calculations, so that they still minimize the memory footprint of the program without significant speed drops.This proposal exists to address this bottleneck within the Neuromapp program created by members of the Blue Brain Project team. The project proposed is split into research and implementation of in-memory compression along the lines of compression library selection, interface algorithm development, and block data structure design. The resulting compression mini-app is intended to relieve this bottleneck, and provide accelerated calculation capacity for the suite of associated mini-apps that come with Neuromapp.",

This will be a Proof of Concept that will aim to research Apache Kafka and Apache HBase as possible solutions to improve the real-time experience of the push metric of the AeroGear Unified Push Server.",

It has already developed good logical structures for sending of push notifications using JMS. Moreover,  its \"sender\" module is mainly constructed of different message queues and their producers and consumers. On the other hand, the server DB is currently based on MySQL/PostgreSQL and each data entry lies in one DB scheme.\n   We need the process for sending of push notifications and the evaluation of message metrics to be as fast as possible and as scalable as possible. Therefore, with an increase of our data problems can be caused by slow writes/reads to DB and not scalable enough message queue usage.\n    The idea of the project is to try to overcome these obstacles and rebuild some modules of the system in the way that they perform well even if the data volume they are operating over increases. For that two different approaches can be taken. To speed up the DB access a new distributed, scalable, big data store HBase can be integrated into the project. For more scalable processing of the data, Apache Kafka can be used instead of JMS.",

It is composed of graphical building blocks (instructions) that must be visually connected to build the program. The idea here is to take benefit of our experience translating from a graphical description of a program in visual HFSM into a JdeRobot-ROS component to do the same with a different visual language, Scratch. The goal is to explore the use of Scratch with robots, both simulated or real, that JdeRobot-ROS allows and simplifies. We will start with simulated robots in Gazebo, despite with real robots will be the same as they use the same interfaces.\nThis project expects to develop a new tool prototype that reads Scratch programs and translate them into ROS Python components.",

After the implementation and testing of oeClient, I will try to exchange static ontologies between PR2s. Then, I conductsome grasp learning experimentusing EULisp. The data gained from these experiments will be used to train models using learning modules in KnowRob. After validation of learned models, these models will be transferred to PR2 in Bremen using oeClient.\nFinally, I will test the learned models with PR2 in Bremen and validate the success of the implemented methodology.",

Review all required features to export digiKam contents through a DLNA server.\nImplement a DLNA server in digiKam core to export photo and video hosted in physical and virtual collections. The server must have the capability to be restored at each digiKam session.\nImplement the server configuration panel in digiKam setup.\nTest the new implementation with DLNA compliant devices, as smartphones, tablets, TVs.\nTest the new implementation under Windows and MacOS.\nWrite unit tests and documentation.",

Competing desktop environments have nowadays a nearly perfect HiDPI support, so I think it is time to face the remaining problems once and for all.Therefore I suggest the following approach:\nMy Google Summer of Code project will find HiDPI rendering issues in KDE applications and fix them in a coordinated approach. I will look at applications, which are usually installed on the users desktop, like the Plasma Workspace, Systemsettings and utilities from the kdegraphics module (gwenview, okular, spectacle).This will also require working together with KDE community members, which report bugs, and application maintainers, to get the submitted patches on the KDE reviewboard in a state that allows them to be committed in their respective repositories.",

Running Qt/KDE GUI solves the issue but its a very dangerous solution. Dangerous because if not handled properly it can cause irreversible damage to the the system. To address this issue some KDE applications are disabling being executed as root. For example, the next versions of Dolphin and Kate will show an error message and exit when started with root privileges.Polkit is just the tool which can solve this problem.

Despite its recent launch in late 2015, it has been widely adopted both in industry and academia. The TensorFlow community recently (in Jan ’17) open sourced a JIT Compiler for linear algebra computations (XLA) to improve speed of execution and reduce memory usage of the program.The LLVM and Polly Labs community has developed an optimization tool, Polly, that works on Polyhedral representations of programs, performing automatic parallelization and data locality optimizations. Polly directly extracts this polyhedral representation of the program and then performs a number of loop optimizations, including tiling and vectorization.The problem statement I am proposing is, to enable Polly's optimizations for XLA. It is well understood that Polly's optimizations work especially well on programs involving deeply nested array update codes like stencils, dense linear algebra kernels, etc, and hence, have applicability in a machine learning library like TensorFlow.",

This project aims to integrate Polly-ACC into Julia and ensure it is able to accelerate compute-intensive parts of Julia programs by focusing on a set of representative benchmarks. It also aims to better optimise code using cues from run-time parameters, leveraging the opportunities that JIT compilation has to offer.

Hence, the false positive rate is relatively high in these paths. That is the reason it is not turned on by default but hidden behind a flag.\nMy project would aim to improve the simulation of the loops in general. Moreover, it would provide an extensible and incremental way of loop widening in which only the relevant regions are invalidated, and thus can be turned on by default.[1] https://reviews.llvm.org/D12358",

Those important data includes the private data, key, or OS fingerprint and else. These kind of attacks lead to concept of “memory obliviousness” to secure memory address itself. ORAM refers to Oblivious memory which can leverage obliviousness using specialized data structures and obfuscate memory access so even an attacker see or probe the memory access itself, he never learns about where important data lies on or even where the memory requests are headed to. Initially proposed by Goldreich and Ostrovsky, ORAM obfuscates memory access using random permutation, shuffling and encryption of contents.

Discoverability is currently another issue, Riot is a completely frontend application so spidering it is near-impossible, this can be solved through making a read-only server generated view for spiders to work on.

The benefit of doing this is twofold, Firstly, it can give faster convergence speed in optimization. Secondly, the freedom of adding different regularization parameters usually gives better results in applications.

In this project a GUI application is built which evaluates these descriptors/key-points. The app also provides a means to benchmark these features for certain vision tasks like Visual Odometry, Tracking and Place Recognition. A second mini project of extending the MRPT ROS package to playback MRPT Datasets in ROS RViz is also implemented.",

The concept of Scenarios has been suggested in the past and would be very important in order to properly develop any notion of “static” worlds such as what would exist for Light & Shadow. In addition, it would provide assistance to creation of exploration worlds such as the suggested Maze world.The implementation of scenarios can be thought of as basically creating a “game maker” style engine built into Terasology.As additional smaller, but very important goals attached to this idea, I intend to extend the currently existing tools for creation which mostly include BlockPicker and StructureTemplates both of these tools work well at what they do, but both are still limited for large creations as they require placing everything by hand. This is where the brush tool I propose can come in handy. The brush tool is designed to allow for “brush-strokes” being made using blocks to quickly create large structures and terraforming. These brush tools would allow for the following interactions.",

PDF.js current uses xhr for networking to fetch data, but it is inefficient in terms of memory as it has to buffer all the response. As xhr is an ever growing buffer, it stores all the data in its internal buffer, this uses lots of memory. Using Streams API, we can use the response incrementally and pass it for parsing and rendering as soon as it is received, hence there is no need to buffer the whole response. For rendering purpose, PDF.js makes chunks of data by parsing pdf commands in worker thread. After chunking the whole data, it is passed to the main thread for painting. Buffering the entire data in the worker thread uses a huge amount memory, and main thread also has to wait for the entire data to be parsed. This creates inefficiency in terms of memory and speed. Using Streams API, we can send the chunks from worker thread to main thread as soon as they are created, reducing the memory usage and increases speed. Since Streams API is a new technology, using it in PDF.js will test Firefox's implementation.",

Then upload these JSON files to GraphSpace using its web interface.\nGraphSpace to Cytoscape: Download a graph’s JSON and style JSON files from GraphSpace and then import these files into Cytoscape.CyGraphSpace will allow users to upload graphs and their styles directly from Cytoscape to GraphSpace without manual intervention and saving of files thus enabling a Cytoscape user to seamlessly share their networks on the web via GraphSpace. A user can also quickly import GraphSpace graphs into Cytoscape, analyze them with other Cytoscape apps, possibly make modifications, and then re-upload them to GraphSpace.

The aim of this project is to move these implementations into the common use of developers by making an extension to Cytoscape.js, which is a commonly used graph drawing library written in Javascript. Cytoscape.js already includes some basic graph traversal algorithms such as DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Kruskal etc., but I believe that these specialized queries will provide a good functionality to be used in not only in biological networks, but also in other types of networks.

For example, the SynBioHub service allows for storage and sharing of SBOL parts, VisBOL allows for creation of SBOL visual images from SBOL files, and iBioSim and SBOL Designer allow for creation and composition of SBOL parts. SBOL Designer and iBioSim allow for upload of parts to an instance of SynBioHub, but there are many opportunities to improve this workflow with authentication, security, and sharing capabilities.",

Many XML variants were developed to represent diagrams, including SBML and SBGN. However, SBML can represent much more complex models than SBGN. For example, the SBML qual extension package can mechanistically describe events in its models, such as the relationship that A activates C, B activates C, but A and B cannot activate C at the same time. The SBGN Activity Flow language can describe a similar relationship, but the relationship is represented visually only, and therefore is not stored in its model. The incompatibilities between SBML and SBGN prevent direct comparison between the models.In this project, I will build tools to support bidirectional conversion between SBML and SBGN, which acts as a machinery to map between SBGN-specific and SBML-specific information.

Studies show that when information is given in steps, with dynamic visual\naids, audience attention and understanding increases dramatically. Ideas presented graphically, as a “story\", are far easier to comprehend and remember than static information. Thus, step-by-step presentations of pathway diagrams would dramatically enhance the educational capabilities of WikiPathways.In this proposal, a new \"Pathway Presenter\" is outlined that will enable biologists to create dynamic presentations of the pathways in WIkiPathways. This will allow for the creation of succinct and easily comprehensible diagrams that can be shared and embedded across multiple platforms.",

The first and essential block is Model itself. Second is Approximation, in some cases $log Q(D)$ is not really needed.

In addition, recent patch update from 1.2.9 to 1.2.10 resulted in a backward compatibility break, and as a minor patch should not raise compatibility issues, the trust in this library is somehow compromised.\nTemplate Engines overcome the majority of the issues related to output generation. They are powerful tools that allow the developers to speed up their work in an easier and much cleaner way.This project proposes moving antiSMASH to jinja2, a well known, widely used and developer-friendly templating language for Python.

At the moment, only six Serif fonts that support Greek are available from Google Fonts and –in my opinion– do not provide this flexibility. Eczar already supports Latin and Devanagari. Devanagari are designed with an axis mirrored in relation to the Latin. This is a significant start regarding the addition of Greek glyphs, since one has a glimpse of the designer’s original aesthetics and design intentions; it also provides a good basis for certain letterforms that could be transferred into the Greek design, rendering a balanced outcome for all the supported scripts.",

However, the need for Astropy to shine as a single package and not just a collection of functionally independent modules, calls for seamless interoperability between the three special and powerful constituents of Astropy: coordinates, time and units and the underlying Astropy table writers. We seek to develop a protocol that allows their storage, the mixin columns, in FITS and ASCII ECSV, while still ensuring \"round-tripping\". Abiding by the rules set by the FITS standard, requires mapping of the special Astropy objects, with extensive associated metadata, to the standard keywords.

With huge multimedia contents available on web, web developers are in need of wide array of image and vision processing algorithms in JavaScript to build innovative applications, such as facial detection in live WebRTC streaming. And this requirement is even more essential for emerging usages on web, such as Web Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality (WebVR). The OpenCV is the de-facto standard C/C++ library for image and vision processing extensively used by computer vision community. But OpenCV is unavailable to web applications today. Thanks to OpenCV.js, an open source project initiated in Parallel Architectures and Systems Group at UC Irvine, by utilizing Emscripten LLVM-to-JavaScript compiler, it makes the first step to prove OpenCV can be exposed to web with high performance. This proposal aims to merge OpenCV.js into official OpenCV repository which makes JavaScript as one of the language bindings of OpenCV. So it requires refactoring the structure, addressing several shortcomings and code optimization of existing OpenCV.js.",

The other proposed top-down saliency method uses high level cues pretrained on ImageNet. Three proposed saliency methods are all better than current OpenCV saliency module. With the result from multiple saliency methods,  background subtraction can be performed by using exponentially decaying method or aggregated saliency optimization framework. The proposed approach tend to be more robust when the background is highly dynamic or the camera is in motion compared with current OpenCV Background Subtraction module.",

So, this algorithm has better performance in this kind of regions.In addition, this algorithm has another pleasant trait: after extraction of LSBP descriptors it processes frames pixel-wise (i.e. independently). This is the common trait among all the consensus-based background models. It means, that implementation can leverage the parallelism inside OpenCV.

As I have tested on TUM Monocular Visual Odometry Dataset, camera pose tracking with photometric calibration has much smaller scale drift than without photometric calibration using Direct Sparse Odometry and LSD-SLAM.

This algorithm was presented by   Jonathan T. Barron and Ben Poole as an ECCV2016 oral and best paper nominee. Algorithm details and applications   can be found in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.03296.pdf [1]Significance:\nThe naive bilateral filtering functions in OpenCV are generally computationally expensive and often insufficient for  solving more challenging computer vision tasks. By contrast, the bilateral solver is 10-1000× faster than existing  domain-specific approaches with comparable accuracy, and produces higher-quality output than lightweight filtering  techniques with comparable runtimes.",

By allowing 3D models to be used in OSM 3D visualizers, the quality and ease of creation of the rendering can be improved. To implement this repository by the proposed deadline, I have decided to use the Django/Python framework, with PostgreSQL as the database backend, and for the front end Bootstrap was chosen. The OpenLayers library will also be used to render slippy maps to the user. The repository includes an user interface allowing uploading models from an authenticated OSM account through the OAuth mechanism, and an API for 3D visualizers to use, so that they can query the repository for models. Finally, while there were a plethora of interesting features that could be included in the deadline checklists, I have opted for only having the essential features required for a 3D repository as deliverables, with the rest as extra features, to be added if time allows it.",

This project aims to give an option to companies and individuals deploying Jangouts to use this service in a user-friendly way. This task can be completed by sending WebRTC events and measurement data from the Jangouts application and the Janus media server in real-time to callstats.io. The idea is to integrate the callstats.io REST API with the WebRTC components in Jangouts and Janus. The Jangouts app will send endpoint stats and Janus will send the stats related to the WebRTC gateway.",

The ZOO-Project is an SDI manager providing the capability to built map and web applications.In this project, I plan to add audio and video data recording facility to MapMint4ME. The main idea is to include SOS input support to MapMint4ME which will enable recording of sensor data directly within the app. The sensor data will be obtained from the sensors embedded on the Android platform. This project will help lots of GIS users, geologists, geographers et cetera who wish to retrieve data from remote areas (where it is not possible to reach) by accessing sensor data directly through the app. Certainly, more functions with extended capabilities could be added in future. I believe that by following a strict timeline as mentioned in the proposal, I will be able to finish the project successfully.",

My project will focus on creating scripts that convert widely-used open data sets into standardized formats for a given location or projection.Users will be able to download multiple data sets and appropriately format the data according to a user-defined location. Automated formatting will allow users to more efficiently utilize information and create ready-to-use data sets available for download.

The app will support combinations of text, images, audio and video - it will use Google Drive for its storage backend. The app will also allow the curators to create a map of the exhibition & beacons - also stored on Drive.Once activated, the beacons will direct visitors to the URI of a webapp that we will also develop. The webapp will run on a server that connects to the Google Drive folder created by the Android app. This webapp, run on the museum’s servers, will use the map along with Web Bluetooth technology to learn the user’s location (by listing nearby beacons and their signal strength) and display to the user the content most relevant.",

The human visual, acting like a low-pass filter, blurs these printed and not printed dots together to create the illusion of continuous shades of gray. Typical halftoning algorithms produce bitmaps as output. However, there are cases when scalable halftone patterns would be useful.Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation and thus obvious choice for scalable graphics. The project aims to create SVG equivalents of standard halftone patterns. These would allow a lower resolution grayscale image to be approximated by an infinite resolution monochrome vector image.",

Frequently it is easier to drop certain records instead of doing such preprocessing for every data source you have.The naive solution here is to wrap up an insert of each record into subtransaction, however, it will ruin COPY performance and burn transaction IDs (XIDs) very rapidly.Parallel execution may help both to boost COPY performance on multi-core systems and to catch errors via running the separated worker processes.",

PostgreSQL uses a double-linked list in the shared memory to record all conflicts of each transaction. Based on the list structure, the rw-conflict tracking has a time complexity of O(N^2). The designer assumed that the list is short so that the overhead can be ignored. However, some benchmarks reported that the conflict-tracking took up to half the CPU time at high concurrency levels, where searching the list becomes a bottleneck. There are five static functions existing in the project to manage the rw-conflicts. We intend to rewrite these functions by replacing linked list with other data structures to support faster search. There are two possible replacements. Hash table is the first choice because there is an existing implementation of hash table (HTAB) in shared memory in PostgreSQL. Skip list is the other choice as it is similar to the linked list.",

Since GIN-Indexes seem very reasonable since GIN is primarily used to search for element values (PK values) that appear within composite items (FK array).  This would greatly decrease the computation time since we can utilize the GIN class operator “<@” (included in).

The core functionality is being implemented. There are a few modules present. Calculations aren’t GPU accelerated. As a result, there is a lag when images larger than 700KB are handled. Also, Image Sequencer works only for browsers currently as it uses a browser dependency (the JavaScript Image Class). Image Sequencer currently supports only one image at a time.The aim of my Project is to expand the module library by implementing powerful processing modules (As listed at the end of this proposal) followed by enabling GPU-backed calculations for browser based clients and hence enhance performance, reliability and speed. And, ultimately, to develop Image Sequencer as an importable library for image manipulation and publish it on NPM. Also, support for Node.js based clients and JSON input/output will be generated.",

It also adds a weight normalization option to the LCMV beamformer (neural activity index and unit noise gain), which will be available for other LCMV versions as well.\nFurthermore, statistical testing of the Hilbert beamformer output using the Wilcoxon rank sum test will be implemented to complete the new Hilbert beamformer pipeline.

Applications are wide, ranging from electronics, process control, machine design, physiology, and economics to ecosystems, climate modeling, electrical power devices and systems, and several others. The transfer function and state-space systems are math representations of the dynamic system and would be explored significantly within the project.\nThe object of this project is to create a control toolbox for R language based on RLabplus and submitting it to CRAN as a package.

R packages like RcppSMC could help to make these methods more accessible.An estimate of the marginal likelihood (normalising constant or evidence) can be obtained as a by-product of SMC (see e.g. Del Moral et al (2006)). Adjusting the current RcppSMC package to allow for estimation of the marginal likelihood would be useful for model choice and for exact-approximate methods such as particle MCMC (Andrieu et al., 2010).There is a plethora of choices for advanced SMC implementations since this is an active area of research.

High-density clusters are defined on a population with density f in r dimensions to be the maximal connected sets of form { x : f(x) >= lambda }, for any lambda > 0. Varying this density level lambda across all possible density thresholds forms a hierarchy of density level sets known as the cluster tree.In 1981, the asymptotic behavior of various linkage criteria were studied by by Hartigan in the context of the cluster tree. During this effort,  a notion of consistency---now often referred to as \"Hartigan consistency\"---was introduced. In the same seminal paper, single-linkage was proven by Hartigan to be inconsistent for dimensions r >= 2.It was not until 2010 that the first computationally tractable and provably consistent algorithm for estimating the cluster tree for  r >= 2 was proven. These results have undoubtedly played a large role in rekindling a number of recent research efforts related to the cluster tree.",

A seminal contribution in this field was the development of the GARCH model by Bollerslev (1986) where the volatility is a function of past asset returns. The GARCH model is today a widespread tool in risk management. However, recent studies show that estimates of GARCH models can be biased by structural breaks in the volatility dynamics (Bauwens et al., 2010; Bauwens et al., 2014). These structural breaks typically occur during periods of financial turmoil. Estimating a GARCH model on data displaying a structural break yields a non-stationary estimated model and implies poor risk predictions. A way to cope with this problem is provided by Markov-switching GARCH models (MSGARCH) whose parameters vary over time according to some regimes. These models can quickly adapt to variations in the unconditional volatility level, which improves risk predictions (see Ardia, 2008).",

This additional layer of manipulation does not exist in standard time series analysis. The package aims to derive the optimal sentiment extraction and aggregation for the forecasting task. Aggregation can be optimized across several dimensions, for example word term weighting schemes or time lag structures. The package created therefore integrates the qualification of sentiment from text, the aggregation into different sentiment measures and the optimized forecasting based on these measures. No such integrated textual sentiment forecasting approach exists in any R package. The goal is to provide an automated means to measure the impact of sentiment in texts on a given variable, obtaining readily interpretable and useful outputs and an object to play with, when using this package.",

ReactOS has a driver capable of reading files from an NTFS volume, but this driver still lacks write support.My previous Google Summer of Code project improved the stability of the NTFS driver, and made significant advances toward write support. This project will continue adding write support and aims to make that support merge-worthy. This will be a major step towards ReactOS' goal of Windows compatibility, and it will be the kind of advancement end-users understand and get excited about.

Those features are far from capturing how does the stimuli actually sound to us, and the best we can do is to ask a human subject to judge.\nThe following project aims to bridge the gap between human- and machine-like sound understanding by building an audio embedding space. Such embeddings have been proven extremely successful for texts (word2vec) and images (image recognition, convolutional neural networks, vgg). The aim of this project is to offer similar insight into the nature of the audio stimuli. \nThe embedding space will be obtained by a machine learning model trained to perform on various audio task. Deliverables are: the architecture (data loading and preprocessing pipeline, deep neural network for universal feature extraction and classifiers train separately for each task), ready-to-load optimized parameters, and a use case tutorial (github repository).",

The main reason is lack of training data from relevant speakers to enroll into the system. Manually extracting such training data by human experts is inefficient, time-consuming or even infeasible at large scale. On the other hand, for a significant part of the archive (videos recorded over a decade since 2007), there are transcripts (the tpt files) that contain caption and speaker information saved along with the videos. These transcripts can potentially be used to automatically extract speaker training data, if they are accurately aligned with the audios. Therefore, the core idea of this proposal is to establish a workflow in the current audio pipeline from Gentle alignment to accurate timestamps of speech boundaries, then to speaker training data, and finally to identified speakers.",

In such a space, algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors can be used for classification. The network weights can be visualized to glean insight about the low- and high-level features it has learned to look for (pitch, timbre, unknowns, etc.) I also propose to obtain visualizations of the embedding space of laughter sounds using dimension reduction techniques like Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).

Therefore the idea is to train our learning algorithms on many such instances, and given a planning problem, output a probability distribution over all the actions (which indicates the relevance of each action).We'll be applying following learning algorithms for getting the probability distribution over actions:The second part of the project is to improve AGGLEditor.

Traditional robot control algorithms for path planning and obstacle avoidance treat all sensor readings identically, as foreign objects that must be avoided. However, for a mobile robot that operates around people, these traditional algorithms may not follow the social norms. Even simple conventions like move to the right when a person is encountered might not be honored by these algorithms. However, people would want to, or rather tend to perceive robots-particularly assistive robots, as human like. So catering to this need social behavior will be implemented via certain cost functions.",

Currently it is doing good job for scientific usage(in IRuby notebook), but if user want to visualize  some data for integration into existing web application, then Daru methods have to output result/chart/graph/datatable such a way that output is directly usable into web application (in html file). Also Daru must have better import/export technique so that new importers/exporters can be defined easily. Mostly modern web application will use NoSql database, that is easy to scale. It will be very useful if Daru can connect with relational or non-relational database and make query operations easy. This project aims to make Daru more powerful for web application to use it as data analysis and visualisation tool, by working on above issues.",

Modular decomposition is decomposition of graph into modules. A module is a subset of vertices and it is a generalization of connected component in graph. Let us take for example a module X. For any vertex v ∉ X it is either connected or not connected to every vertex of X. Another property of module is that a module can be subset of another module. There are various algorithms which have been published for modular decomposition of graphs. The focus in this project is on linear time complexity algorithms which can be practically implemented. The project further aims to use the modules developed for modular decomposition to implement other functionality like skew partitions. Skew partition is partition of graph into two sets of vertices such that induced graph formed by one set is disconnected and induced graph formed by other set is complement of the first. \nModular decomposition is a very important concept in Graph Theory and it has a number of use cases. For instance it has been an important tool for solving optimization and combinatorics problems.",

By providing the first “international” version and further extending the free games section, I hope previously excluded groups will be able to enjoy the game just as much as the original and contribute to ScummVM’s increasing popularity.",

The dataset I will work with is the MIMIC database, which is comprised of information relating to patients admitted to the ICU at a large hospital. The data mainly includes demographic, administrative, and clinical data from over 45,000 critical care patients. The project will be divided into two parts: In the first part, I plan to perform data cleaning and apply various machine learning algorithms on the MIMIC dataset for mortality prediction, predict the risk of developing certain diseases, determine the effectiveness of certain drugs, and more. In the final part, I will explore more novel methods like LSTMs to exploit the time-series data. Recent research has shown good results of using deep learning on electronic health records.",

HPXCL aims at unifying kernel launch and data transfer into HPX asynchronous graph through seamless integration. However, the current implementation of the system with CUDA fails to achieve the desired performance improvement metrics while running in a cluster of computers. The proposal is aimed at improving the performance of CUDA-based HPXCL applications through an ‘Event’ triggered mechanism. Appropriate tests are also to be written to ensure necessary functionality performs as required.

Our main goal is to understand RDMA and it’s deployment, configuring RDMA over Conventional Ethernet(RoCE), deploying RDMA-Spark on RoCE and finally deploying SparkGIS on RDMA-Spark. After all these deployments are done, we will shift our focus to optimizing SparkGIS for more accurate and faster results.",

Unfortunately, because the technology being used is bleeding edge it is inevitable that attacks or hacks will target these apps for monetary reasons.\nBecause of the immutability property of Ethereum after publishing even if developers identify a critical bug in the contract it is not possible to correct it.Thus, in order to fill the gap of not having a proper 'smart contract' compatible monitoring service, we propose to build a web application that can monitor other smart contracts in Ethereum and give the capability to safeguard its critical functions (Ether send and receive) and interact and visualize with smart contract functions in a much simpler way.",

But hex-meshing is a hard problem and is often done by parameterizing tetrahedral meshes and extracting hexahedral meshes using certain heuristic rules. Numerical inconsistencies and extraction of non-hexahedral polytopes can be avoided at the extraction stage.\nThe algorithm to be implemented is delineated in the paper by Lyon et al: HexEx: Robust Hexahedral Mesh Extraction. My work is to incorporate the algorithm to create hexahedral meshes using combinatorial maps package in CGAL.CGAL has a generalized maps package, which generalizes representation of any oriented object of n-dimensions with n-dimensional subdivisions, each of which is stored as a set of darts and pointers that point to other darts, which could be thought of as an oriented edge or 1-cell. We use this data structure to hold the hexahedral subdivisions of the 3D object. The package has classes to define implementations of darts, cells, generalized maps, which will be used for the implementation.",

To answer the needs of automotive industry in this manner with an open-source approach, recent studies have been made such as the Eclipse-based APP4MC platform. Although APP4MC provides sufficient tooling in parallel computing for automotive domain, the demonstration and evaluation of its results would improve its performance and allow to investigate the optimization of goals such as resource usage and energy consumption. With the project, software distribution challenges for such automotive systems should be analyzed upon instruction precise modeling, affinity constrained distribution, and reducing task response times achieved by advanced software parallelization.

Valgrind is a memory checking tool that detects memory problems such as leaks. However, it is unable to understand which areas of our JVM memory are accessible (such as identify user space). My goal is to teach it which regions are available thereby detecting memory issues more accurately.This is done by using memcheck API to tell memcheck about allocated memory pool, inform it when new regions are added and destroyed and inform it of individual objects created and destroyed in the those regions (in the pool). Garbage collector also doesn't track individual objects that memcheck needs to know while freeing, and this project also solves that problem by storing them globally on allocation and removing them on free. This is implemented across all GC schemes in OMR.Code: https://github.com/eclipse/omr/pull/1311/Docs: https://github.com/eclipse/omr/blob/master/doc/Valgrind%20Memcheck%20API.mdHeader: https://github.com/eclipse/omr/blob/master/gc/base/MemcheckWrapper.hpp",

Usings the tools already built into Guile, this allows Guile to act as the full stack for small scale web sites, and provides a path for Guile based software like GNU Lilypond to be run on the web.It also provides further validation of Guile's Compiler Tower design, showing that backends can be written as easily as front ends.In a previous summer of code, I was able to compile a large portion of the cps language to Javascript and ported a large section of boot-9 (Guile's basic prelude), which meant I could run programs of some complexity, including using continuations for search, and mutually recursive numerical programs.

But there is a glitch here because transcoding the video into so many qualities may take too much time.Hence, I plan to use Celery's prioritized tasking with Rabbitmq to tackle this problem. The video will be rendered to the user just after the video is transcoded to 480p, and then subsequently the option for different qualities is given as and when the video is transcoded to that quality.At the end of the project, I will be handling the front-end part of the project where the option to choose different resolutions will be added to the video player.

This system should accept user requests for analytic jobs and utilize distributed machine learning techniques and tools in order to extract knowledge out of the malware-related Big Data available. The system output for the analyst should be a graphical representation of the generated results.",

This enumeration may identify many invalid heap configurations that violate properties of the data structures in the heap, which leads to a huge amount of false alarms.We aim to tackle this problem by using separation logic, a well-known assertion language designed for reasoning about heap-manipulating programs. We will build a system, Java StarFinder (JSF), that enables users to describe properties of the data structures in the heap using separation logic. JSF is a symbolic execution engine, built on top of SPF, that generates path conditions (PCs) in the form of separation logic. These PCs are checked by a solver for satisfiability and test input generation. In addition, JSF can verify program correctness by collecting PCs satisfying some given preconditions and verifying if these PCs satisfy user-provided assertions.",

This turns program repair into a search problem over the space of code snippets characterized by constraints derived via symbolic execution, the “semantic search” problem.  Previous work in this area was done exclusively with C programs, and the extension of this work to Java would be of major benefit for program repair research.For GSoC, I propose to use SPF to empirically quantify the degree to which such an approach is possible using currently-existing open-source Java programs, create functionality-searchable database of Java code snippets, and use this with existing efforts for search-based program repair.",

Yet some models, especially nonparametric ones, also require discrete parameters and/or hand-written jump steps; and existing tools for HMC generally don't play well with discrete parameters. My project is intended to generally improve the Julia toolchain for MCMC when there is a mix of continuous and discrete parameters. My work will be based on Mamba.jl; though when I can make something that will be useful to Klara.jl too, even better. To make that plan concrete, I'll be implementing CrossCat, a general-purpose nonparametric model for \"medium-size\" tabular data including missingness and various data types.

However, the “inverse problem”, the problem of parameter estimation based on the measurements of output variables, has not been well explored using modern optimization and statistical methods. Parameter estimation aims to find the unknown parameters of the model which give the best fit to a set of experimental data. In this way, parameters which cannot be measured directly will be determined in order to ensure the best fit of the model with the experimental results. This will be done by globally minimizing an objective function which measures the quality of the fit. This inverse problem usually considers a cost function to be optimized (such as maximum likelihood). This problem has applications in systems biology, HIV-AIDS study.",

Rebuilding Interact.jl on top of WebIO.jl will bring Interact beyond IJulia, to the Atom/Juno IDE and to desktop apps with Electron/Blink.jl. Additionally it should enable Escher.jl to reuse much of Interact, which will likely reduce Escher’s size and complexity significantly, increasing its stability. Furthermore, by removing its dependence on Jupyter and IPywidgets, Interact will gain flexibility to produce more complex UIs which intermix displayed data such as plots, and UI controls. Finally, I plan to add some automated UI testing which hopefully will assist in improving the stability of not just Interact and Escher, but potentially IJulia, Juno, and Blink as well.",

An initiator must always try to send IKE_SA_INIT over UDP first, and if there are a certain number of transmission fails then only it should fall back to TCP. Another thing to do would be to schedule checks for UDP so we can go to establishing the tunnel using UDP if it becomes available and tear down the TCP IPsec tunnel. The above two steps are to be done as TCP encapsulation adds overheads and has performance trade offs compared to UDP, therefore we should always prefer using UDP unless required otherwise. Once the TCP support is added, we need to look into enabling ESPinTCP support in the kernel. The kernel must be able to identify TCP packets where the first 4 bytes are zero and we must tell the kernel to process ESPinTCP packets.

Therefore there exists a need for extension so that other methods, such as ECDSA or EDDSA can be used easily.

This also includes building releases, testing them and debugging the system files (written in C) to make them work. Currently, Anita only has support for qemu (and experimental support for running NetBSD as Xen DomU). Unlike BSD, Linux has a kernel module known as KVM, which allows a user space program to utilize the hardware virtualization features of various processors and can be utilized by qemu to provide “KVM acceleration” when the target architecture is the same as host architecture. The lack of such support makes qemu really slow on NetBSD. Testing system installation on a wide variety of platforms is very crucial for any organisation that’s into OS business. It can be a frustrating task to do that manually, but, if neglected can be a make or break situation for the OS (adoption/marketing). Automated testing with Anita makes the job a cakewalk. Support for Xen and Virtualbox will further enhance the capabilities of Anita.",

DCTCP starves the throughput of other TCP flows (e.g., Reno, Cubic, etc) when they co-exist; so one of the goals is to ensure that TCP Prague can co-exist with other TCP flows without degrading their throughput. Although TCP Prague is still a work in progress, some related modules have been finalised and briefly experimented, such as: the Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable throughput (L4S) service architecture, DualQ Coupled AQM, Modified ECN Semantics for Ultra Low Queueing Delay. Availability of these modules in network simulators like ns-3 is crucial to boost up the ongoing efforts of standardizing TCP Prague. In this project, the aim is to implement the above mentioned modules in ns-3. Additionally, the functionality of these modules will be tested, and the necessary documentation with some examples will also be provided.",

For example, we may want to give priority to some flows while limiting bandwidth of other flows or even perform packet classification. To solve such problems, we have a traffic control layer in ns-3 which intercepts the packets flowing between the L2 Net devices and any IP protocol. It uses several qdiscs like pfifo, HBT, RED, CoDel etc., in order to process these packets and perform scheduling or shaping. Currently the ns-3 traffic layer only contains traffic scheduling qdisc models (AQMs) and lacks realistic traffic shaping algorithms. This project aims to introduce the TBF and HHF algorithms into the ns-3 traffic control layer. TBF is a classless traffic shaper, that is used to control the flow rate or bandwidth of the throughput. HHF is a size-based qdisc that attempts to differentiate small and heavy flows. The goal is to catch the heavy flows and move them to a separate queue with less priority so that bulk traffic does not affect the latency of critical traffic.",

Until today ns-3 – which aims to replace the aging ns2 and its associated old-featured simulators –  does not have even in its latest version a MIPv6 module that is fully compliant to the IETF specification. To fill this gap, I am going to implement a novel MIPv6 simulation model which can be integrated into ns-3.\nThe project idea aims at testing the code in different network scenarios, containing different link layer technologies such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX and LTE. The current implementation of LTE does not have support of IPv6 in ns-3. So, the idea of testing MIPv6 code into LTE would follow IPv6 support implementation in LTE first and then the MIPv6 support. So, ns-3 researchers can benefit themselves with the addition of this feature. \nThus, implementation of MIPv6 in ns-3 as the base mobility management solution and providing LTE support within it could help the current network researchers working on ns-3.",

Instead, an alternative solution using Windows is suggested in the official document which is more complex than the regular patterns and less memory efficient when it comes to one-time pattern detection. The solution I propose here provides a native implementation for patterns to identify the events that do not arrive.",

Also the load on committers/reviewers drops down drastically with this as obvious bugs fail to pass the automatic testing phase and alerting the developers that something has gone wrong before they ask for reviews. Through this project we can aspire to improve upon both these aspects and hence result in a big enhancement to the developer experience.
