Therefore, it is necessary to replace “show” GUI with a more general framework such as Qt5.  3DTK developers have already started this rewriting, and this project is called “qtshow”.  However, “qtshow” still misses a lot of functionality compared to  “show”.  Because of this, I improve these problems and add some features which are in “show” but not in “qtshow”.",

Major users of such data are fishermen or sailors. They need to know the positions of dangerous storms, hurricanes etc and allow them to move away from them. Generally, the weather images can be downloaded from the internet, but the ships rarely have an internet connection. Hence for this, one of the solutions is that NOAA weather satellites freely send the weather images and data down to earth continuously. This is perfect for us, the users can simply have a simple and cheap RTL-SDR device and capture this freely available weather data. Currently, this is possible, but there are no opensource tools that come with the complete package. Usually, one software is used to capture and demodulate FM and then the decoded audio is fed into the other software to decode the image. This complex procedure needs a human's manual input and the raw IQ file may be lost in the process. This project intends to solve this. The open source tool that will be developed will have all the required functionalities.",

In it’s current state, the user has to use a configuration file to state what protocols/variables/graphs he is going to use during his experiment. However, the need to change the application’s layout is evident, and the student should not be forced to close the ground station, change the configuration file again, and re-open the application to resume his experiment. This goes against the initial principle of the groundstation.There needs to be a way for the user to quickly and easily adapt the groundstation to his experiment, without having to worry too much about it. The goal of this project is to implement a set of new features that allow the user to manipulate the Ground Station’s data and layout. In order to accomplish this, I plan on creating a tool that allows the end user to specify exactly how he want his station to look and work.",

About the client side, I will creat a client application simple, from there, the user can search for metadata they are interested in CSW.\nImplementing OGC CSW is not only applicable for VNSC but also for other space agencies in searching images by criteria since the metadata used in this project (provided by VNSC) is largely used by other space agencies.

It will also support conversion from different binary hair file formats to the new native format. Finally, the addition of an advanced hair shading model that is tuned for production rendering. It is a physically based hair shader that captures the effects of the light scattering through hair fibres. The model is importance sampled and also has various parameters to change physical properties in the hair like refractive index and colour absorption and distribution.

This approach works well when the multicopter is flying at high altitudes without obstructions. In case of low altitude flights though, it becomes difficult for the drone to navigate autonomously and requires sensors to restrain it from colliding with the obstacles around. This is done by locally dividing the regions around the multicopter into sectors and scaling the attitude proportional to the distance from obstacles. This would sometimes lead to the vehicle to stop and a manual intervention would be required to let it out of the obstruction.Situations like these could be avoided if a planning algorithm could take advantage of the observations made previously in the form of a 3D map and use it to direct the multicopter in the collision free path maintaining the global plan for waypoint navigation. This could be done by building a framework for mapping which would utilize depth information from stereo cameras or lidars and generate an occupancy map. The planner would use this map and global plan as an input and generate control commands for the multicopter to navigate autonomously.",

Keras uses Tensorflow as a backend for doing all the ML. Using Native Implemented Functions (NIF) and the Tensorflow C API as a backend, a low-level wrapper will be written in Elixir. This low-level API will then be used to write a Keras-like framework in the form of a high-level API.

Since python libraries like networkx don't have extensive support for network visualizations like Gephi, visualizing high dimensional networks become very hard. Multiple issues like node overlaps, label overlap , lack of utility functions, having a bad layout complicate the task of coming to a good network visualization.To solve it we implement Mediaviz, a network visualization library which has been deployed as a package into pip. It provides functionalities for force based layout such as force atlas 2, automatic scaling to prevent node overlap, Gephi like features for network filtering, coloring, node resizing, prevention of label overlap and community visualization. Mediaviz uses force atlas 2 layout as default and scales the layout automatically for graphs with 100-1000 nodes that has a power law linking structure, but it can also be used with other layout algorithms.",

However, this model faces many issues when used to represent dynamic materials such as smoke or clouds, which have innumerable and constant shifts in number and location of vertices, edges, and faces. These types of objects are typically classed and implemented separately as Volumes.Due to the nature of the materials involved, Volume rendering requires a different set of solutions in regards to data structuring, light sampling, and so on. Quickly becoming an industry standard, OpenVDB is a Volume rendering framework developed by Dreamworks that sees wide usage throughout the graphics industry such as in Pixar's RenderMan and Houdini. It is known for its efficiency in handling sparse data sets and its wide range of filters, transformation operators, compositing tools, and many other features for the creation and robust manipulation of Volumes. Its integration into Cycles will surely further Blender's usage in the 3D graphics scene.",

The idea is to track a small subset of entries in the full frequency spectrum and interpolate to recover the full AFS to proceed with integration for larger sample sizes. The key problem is how to recover the frequency spectrum accurately, so several experiments would be carried out to tune parameters and implementations. Also, a framework is expected to be developed for balancing the trade off between computational complexity and data recovery accuracy, that is, deciding which kind of data should be computed with approximation and which should be computed directly.",

The uploading module will upload the processed stream files, and also share sample with other universities if required.Nephos will be developed, using Python and few other open source projects, to accomplish all the above mentioned tasks with cent-percent reliability and zero failures (unless wrong data is input, which will be logged/prompted).

To achieve this, a Lightweight Sites Specification document has been created that will allow the software configuration of the entire site through a central module. This would be the Level 1 configuration. In addition, other Lightweight Sites Components would be created according to specifications. One such component includes the repositories for containers of different compute elements (CE), batch systems, worker nodes (WN), etc. These containers are also configured and comprise the Level 2 configurations. In the past, YAIM, an in-house configuration tool has been used for Level 2 configurations.

This algorithm has a lot of potential owing to the fact that it can generate data that is quite similar to the data given for learning in addition to faster generation of samples when compared to fully visible belief nets. It therefore makes GANs immensely useful in simulation of particle physics and astrophysical data.Since ROOT is a data analysis tool extensively used for applications in particle physics and features a dedicated machine learning submodule, Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis (TMVA), it is essential to include a GAN implementation in the toolkit.My project would focus on integrating an optimized GAN implementation in the TMVA DNN library with the help of already existing implementations of Deep Network Models.

These events aim to mirror the behavior of a particle interacting with a specific detector hardware. Some modules are independent of others, so they can be run in parallel; this is the current state of the multithreading used in the framework, but it does not make good use of available CPU cores. The aim of this proposal is thus to run full events in parallel instead, greatly enhancing CPU core utilization. This however requires some internal restructure and presents new problems not shared with the current approach, such as the issue of event execution order.

DIRAC’s jobs may have several parameters, and carry important information which should be kept, for users and administrators alike. The information gathered from the parameters is currently stored in a relational database system in a key-value pair format. Traceability of the jobs becomes difficult as it becomes very hard to perform queries on such database.Hence, I would like to extend the current job monitoring system, currently based upon relational databases, by using non-relational database (NoSQL), which is ElasticSearch, a state of the art solution on which queries become easier on a large number of jobs.Also, the current DIRAC development is in python2, hence I would like to make my code 2to3 tool complaint, so that my submissions can be easily ported to python3 using this tool.",

A friend of mine suggested that CiviCRM has many features that campaign staff would use for political campaigns. He suggested two things that CiviCRM lacks that keep it from being competitive with other CRMs  like NGPVan or NationBuilder:This summer, I would like to work towards both of these goals. I think that the first goal --- making a \"turf cutting\" extension for CiviCRM using Leaflet --- is a good baseline goal for the summer. I have a prototype that communicates with CiviCRM using the REST APIs, so it's in reach.The second goal --- integration with a mobile canvassing app --- is a stretch, but worth working towards too. I've been rewriting the open-source canvassing app, Field The Bern, to be independent of Bernie infrastructure, and think it's a great candidate for CiviCRM integration. If time permits, I'd like to work on a CiviCRM extension to integrate with phones running Field the Bern.",

However the CLTK lemmatizer is not currently able to identify synonyms for a given word, or suggest translations into other languages.I propose to modify the existing CLTK lemmatizer to look up synonyms and translations for Latin and Greek. I will adapt CLTK’s unique ‘backoff’ approach to lemmatization in order to measure the probability of each possible synonym and/or translation for a target word given its context. Further, I propose to incorporate vector models for Latin and Greek based on word embeddings trained using the word2vec algorithm. Once synonyms, translations, and vector models are incorporated into CLTK, users will be able to perform cutting-edge tasks like sentence length document alignment. This will open new horizons for digitally assisted classical scholarship.",

I intend to work on the idea of improving Demo Creation in Origami which includes solving existing issues in demo creation, proposing and implementing some new features and reporting new issues that exist.\nThe current implementation of Demo Creation in Origami is not ideal and is still evolving, there are a lot of deadlocks where it struggles and is not very intuitive. Providing user a way to easily create and manage demos for their deep learning model is the primary goal of Origami which can be greatly improved. To enhance user experience some changes are needed in UI and in the feature list of Origami. Incorporating all these changes would be the primary goal of my GSoC project.",

Lots of temporal information can be gathered from cuneiform artifacts, from the dating of the object to specific dates at which events happened in the text. In concert with the ongoing rewrite of the CDLI codebase (“CDLI Framework update”), this project will result in the extension and improvement of the current data model for temporal information, by structuring the data in a new, richer model which will enable the full utilization of relationship among these data. The new structure will be exploited so artifacts can be searched and displayed based on this temporal information and in a granular manner.",

We will then evaluate our system using existing architectures available for semantic role labeling with the projected SRL data. The final system also involves the production of word embeddings for Sumerian which can be documented and used for improving other downstream tasks like POS tagging, dependency parsing, etc. The developed SRL system will have many potential applications, viz. in the fields of document summarization, machine translation and also towards a better abstract semantic representation of the originally sparse textual data.",

While we do this, it is imperative that these embeddings are able to accommodate the semantic relatedness between entities. This means that we are not limiting ourselves with just the similarity between words, instead we take a step further ahead to also define the relatedness between the vectors and thus the relation between the entities and the text. Therefore, to incorporate this measure of the semantic distance, we define a measure of descriptiveness of the class that these entities belong to. Entities belonging to a class that has a very high level of description must have very low semantic distance in our model. Eventually, we extend the usability by predicting embeddings for out-of-vocabulary entities as well, and also extract relations between those entities using approaches that have been previously used for link prediction tasks in machine learning.",

Daniel Pocock's blog \"Want to be selected for GSoC?\" lists some of these steps with more details. This project involves creating a Python script with a GUI that helps applicants and interns complete as many of these steps as possible, in less than an hour. Imagine that a student has only just installed Debian, they install this script from a package using Synaptic and an hour later they have all their accounts, communications tools, development tools and a blog (using Jekyll/Git) up and running.",

For example, encrypting a message using the primary key, decrypting the encrypted message using the private key, and so on, these tools can help the user better understand the concepts of encryption.A tutorial is comprised of lessons which contain text, images, questions and code snippets. It is a comprehensive guide for a particular concept. For example, Encryption 101, How to use git?, What is a mailing list? and so on.In addition to providing the Tools and Tutorials, this application is build to be progressive. One can easily contribute new Tutorials by just creating a JSON file, the process of which is documented in the project repository itself.

To deal with that, better accurate machine learning approaches, such as Deep Learning (DL), are needed to transform raw data into applicable Information. Several DL architectures (e.g. CNN, semantic segmentation) rely only at spatial dimension to perform, for example, land-cover/land-use (LCLU) maps, disregarding the temporal dependencies between pixels observations over the time. Also, high-res remote sensing data (e.g. Planet, Sentinel) may provide more consistent time-series, that can be use in the identification of important LCLU classes, like crop, pastureland and grasslands.This potential can be explored using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), a specific family of DL approaches which can take into account time dimension. A promising project idea would be implement a RNN approach (e.g. LSTM) to classify a Sentinel time-series that is able to produce a map for one or more LCLU classes and ship the final version of the model into the Pycoal library as part of the COAL project.",

Automated analysis for such data can simplify the development process, by enabling an ffi-generator to generate bindings for Java , ideally without requiring any manual input from the developer. Since the project is mostly exploratory, the analysis is intended to be conservative, but never wrong, in the sense that it should not recommend a return type of a for a function that may return null, but may recommend Maybe a for a function that never returns null.

As part of Fedora IoT, Peter Robinson ideated the Atomic Host Upgrade Daemon, which builds on the Atomic Project and rpm-ostree, a project also labeled “Git for Operating Systems”. This monitoring daemon will re-use the work done for Atomic Updates for IoT system, allowing for automatic checking for available upgrades, applying them, rebooting, checking the system status and, in case of errors, rolling back the changes.",

In the present implementation, we have transformed websites generated through open-event-webapp to be Progressive Web App(PWA), due to which service workers are already enabled. Therefore we can now move to further enhancement like push-notifications of bookmarked events by any user, also we need to improve the user interface for the dark theme enabled recently to project. The present testing suite requires some more tests for the functionalities like direct linking of tracks and rooms so the aim is to write mocha unit tests with selenium webdriver for the recently added features and the proposed ones. The travis build for the selenium tests run for around 20 minutes, which is quite large so the aim is to parallelize the build so that multiple builds can be performed at the same time and runtime can be decreased significantly.",

The goal of the project is to convert all the PCI drivers attachments to be table driven and mark with PNP_INFO. \nThe devmatch infrastructure gives us a way to match up hardware with kernel modules that implement drivers that claim the hardware. The problem is that the drivers need some modification before devmatch can use them. Specifically, they need to have their device ID scans done via a table, and that table needs to be decorated with a PNP_INFO tag so the compiler and kld_xref extract the metadata that devmatch needs to do this job. As the PCI drivers are all over the place in terms of how they match device IDs work will be needed to move some of the in-line code to tables, some of the tables lookups may be able to move to standardized routines, etc. Trimming GENERIC to show that the drivers work is also required.\nThere are about 243 such PCI drivers. grep -r 'DRIVER_MODULE., pci,'  | wc is used to find out. The plan is to convert a significant portion of them and maintain a documentation of the conversion.",

Identification of Gene Orthology Relation is the most important task of Comparative Genomics, as they tend to preserve similar molecular and biological functions. Thus if we can establish orthology relationships between two genes, we can obtain valuable evolutionary history of the two genes. However, with advanced sequencing depth and expansion in transcriptome data, genes are no longer the proper units for interrogation in functional conservation, evolutionary events, and expressional patterns, especially in the field of alternative splicing. As the accumulation of transcriptomic data, alternative splicing is taken into account in the assignments of gene orthologs and the orthology is suggested to be further considered at transcript level. Whether gene or transcript orthology, exons are the basic units that represent the whole gene structure; however, there is not much reported study on how to build exon level orthology in a whole genome scale. Therefore, it is essential to establish a transcription oriented gene orthology algorithm.",

It is a multiscripts display font with 8 weights from thin to black and have a strong calligraphic influence. It has a lot of personality so it can be recognisable in headlines or brand names uses. Regarding the history of Greek script, it is both interesting and challenging to design a typeface with a calligraphic feel: in terms of design but also in terms of study.Arima Madurai already supports Tamil, Malayalam and Latin scripts and I would like to add Greek extended script to the glyphset. The fact that the font already supports multi scripts is a real benefit to the project: Arima Madurai already acts in non latin typographic environment and therefore displays a large set of shapes that can be used to match the Greek glyphs with the other ones.",

Post-script outline quality improved significantly, spacing has been reworked and new weights have been added.The family is currently growing to support additional writing systems.

A second metric could be the performance of the model in language specific tests. Last but not least, we could evaluate the model in real world data offered by Official Greek Government's Gazette (FEK-ΦΕΚ) for named entities extraction and  document categorization as mentioned in the ideas list of GFOSS for GSOC 2018.\nWith respect to sentiment analysis, I would like to implement a binary classifier that, given a piece of text in Greek language, can computationally identify and categorize  the opinions expressed and more specifically to determine whether the writer's attitude towards the topic is positive or negative. The classifier will also return a polarity score which will serve as a measure of confidence of the classifier for its’ decision.",

Gradually the user bases of Windows and MacOS X are growing, and a simple concise way of building the tool must be provided to the users. To accomplish this, I aim to simplify the build process for Windows and MacOS X.Currently, the suite is completely terminal-based and can only read from and write reports to local files and needs to be installed and executed in the user’s machine. To deal with this, I aim to provide a network interface to run the suite as a service that would allow users to validate their own remote files, or a dynamically generated VCF stream.If the input VCF is compressed, it is the user's responsibility to decompress it. My task is to reduce this extra step by making the validator itself capable of decompressing such files.I would investigate how to insert checksums of reference genome sequences in the VCF header.",

This proposal will expand the software receiver to accommodate acquisition and tracking of Beidou B2a signals that would further expand the receiver's capabilities in facilitating research on multi-constellation and multi-frequency receivers working with real signals. In addition, the demodulation of the navigation messages will open the door to innovation in multi-constellation receivers, addressing topics such as integrity, reliability, robustness, enhanced coverage, and high-accuracy positioning. Furthermore, the integration of Beidou observables into the position velocity time solution will allow the achievement of the aforementioned diverse range of applications and components.",

It should also be able to provide the users, an easy method to select and execute the corrections suggested and enable/disable the feature. This could get tricky as Octave comes in both a GUI and a CLI. Therefore, for a successful integration of this feature with Octave, understanding how its parser, error handling, and internal functions work would be essential. The next part of the problem would be to generate the words to suggest. A trivial solution of this problem is easy but computationally expensive and hence not feasible. The challenging part therefore, is to minimize the speed-accuracy trade-off of the feature. A starting point for that would be a smart (probability based for example) implementation of the Edit-distance algorithm, using dynamic programming. Later, a Neural Network based idea would also be tested. The goal of-course, is to use the algorithm that best minimizes the speed-accuracy trade-off and provides the best UX.",

The WebRTC standard will be able to provide support to Godot's existing multiplayer in making these sorts of peer-to-peer games.It will also make multiplayer viable in the HTML5 target platform, and allow for easy interfacing with non-Godot peers that use WebRTC.  Additionally, the support I build for WebRTC will make it easy to later add WebRTC MediaStreams, allowing for in-game voice chat.

A unified high level interface means that a model can be configured easily and only once and then it can be deployed on all supported simulators. Different simulators provide diverse features and also might use various numerical approaches and approximations leading to possibly different results. Having an option to compare data from several simulators without extra work is a great feature PyNN offers.GeNN is an efficient neural network simulator written in C++. The characteristic feature of this simulator is the ability to run simulation on GPU thus greatly decreasing required computational time.Interfacing GeNN from PyNN would be a valuable acquisition for both projects. PyNN will have another, faster simulator at hand and GeNN will get a python interface. Python is much more widespread among the neuroscientists. Having such an interface will help to make GeNN more popular and hopefully will reduce the time scientists spent on their simulations.",

It is clear however, that the brain is active even when the subject is not performing a task. In fact, according to certain estimates, task-related changes in neuronal metabolism only account for about 5% of the brain’s total energy consumption. Resting state fMRI is a comparatively newer approach used to identify synchronous BOLD changes in multiple brain regions while the subjects lie comfortably in the scanner without performing a task. The correlations between spontaneous BOLD signals can be used to study intrinsic functional connectivity. The analysis is also useful in situations where it is advantageous to explore the brain’s functional organization in neurological or psychiatric diseases. INCF currently has a tool to retrieve the hemodynamic response function at rest from resting state fMRI, however, the code is currently written in MATLAB. In order to increase its diffusion and portability, the repository has to be converted to Python and follow the BIDS - Standards to eventually create the portable neuroimaging pipeline.",

PracMLN is an open-source toolkit that can be used to perform statistical relational learning (SRL) and probabilistic logic inference based on the Markov Logic representation. It was developed at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bremen.However, the software is written entirely in Python and can thus be slow at times. This project aims to rewrite some computationally intensive portions of PracMLN in Cython, and thus improve performance issues. Intelligent use of Cython's static typing functionality, which is unavailable in Python, will hopefully enable significant speedup, along with more extensive use of other similarly optimised libraries (such as NumPy).Additionally, this work will be documented (https://kaivalyar.github.io/gsoc18-pracmln/) in order to make further optimisation easier.

Surface reconstruction would produce more human-friendly maps. However, several issues need to be solved for performing surface reconstruction on real-time SLAM result. This includes globally optimize 3D points, enforcing smoothness,etc.Besides, it's possible to solve the problem via an offline-SLAM approach (with surface reconstruction), because it's highly related with that.The main part of this project is related to offline-SLAM, to compensate some trade-offs made by real-time SLAM for real-time consideration.

The tool can publish relevant message or subscribe service to change parameter.Navigation receives configure from GUI node and obstacle information from gazebo. It calls the OMPL api and publish ROS path message. If the robot model is devoted to route, this node should update the new planning path based on new robot pose.Although it just needs a known scenario in claim, I think it is convenience that we can change obstacle position freely. The gazebo plugin for obstacle can publish self-information or subscribe navigation’s service to change obstacle information.When navigation node publish the Path message, a robot model and its path following function is needed to complete this motion. Conveniently, I will use robot models in the JdeRobot such as turtlebot and adrone.Integrate all the above and implement the integral ROS gazebo simulation framework.",

It is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support. It uses the kpmcore library to automate partitioning procedures.One pending feature request for Calamares remains for LVM support. LVM support is currently finished in kpmcore and KDE Partition Manager, but there is some work to do in Calamares before proceeding to the other goals of this project. Furthermore, it is currently needed to implement RAID support in kpmcore, KDE Partition Manager and Calamares, which will offer a way to spread data across several disks, such that a single disk failure will not lose that data.",

If the process of applying the images on canvas is not fast enough the painting process gets compromised and the enjoyment of painting is reduced.Optimizing the mask creation can be done using the AVX instructions sets to apply transformation in vectors of data in one step. In this case the data is the image component coordinates composing the mask. Programming AVX can be done using Vc optimization library, which manages low level optimization adaptable to the user processor features. However the data must be prepared so it optimizes effectively. Optimization has already been done on the Default brush mask engine allowing it to be as much as 5 times faster than the current Gaussian mask engine.The project aims to improve painting performance by implementing AVX optimization code for Circular Gauss, Circular Soft, Rectangular Gaussian, Rectangular Soft Rectangular and Stamp mask.",

RCU allows concurrent readers to access protected data in a non-blocking way even during updates or removals. RCU, as with the rest of the Linux Kernel, is written in C.The project idea is a binding of RCU for use in Lunatik, thus allowing synchronization of Lua data via RCU.",

Maybe we dont need to use cache to fix this maybe some other mechanism can be implemented to prevent this from happening which is why I need a mentor :).

It has a plethora of applications in fields like information retrieval and recommendation system. Also, many machine learning approaches rely on some metric. This includes unsupervised techniques such as clustering, supervised procedures like KNN classification and semi-supervised modes as well. Metric learning has been involved as a preprocessing step for many of these approaches.Henceforth learning a neat distance metric is a crucial task for forming similarities. LMNN & BoostMetric are among the supervised distance metric learning techniques which excel in this task.

Most collaborative filtering algorithms, including the ones existing in mlpack, use matrix factorization for this. Although MF is de facto, it cannot deal with complex user-item relationships and also need the user to provide ratings explicitly (explicit feedback). This project proposal deals with these drawbacks by implementing a module for neural collaborative filtering, which can represent complex user-item interaction using neural networks and also can handle implicit feedback (comprising any interaction user has with any item as a positive instance). Neural collaborative filtering, if needed, can also be generalized to matrix factorization. NCF has been proved to give better hit ratio and other metrics than neighborhood based algorithms, and also gives comparable RMSE with existing CF methods in mlpack. This module can give much more flexible recommendations, even when there is less explicit feedback available.",

This creates a wealth of content for the player to choose from.\nOr at least that is the intention. Currently the major content for Terasology is extremely similar to content seen in other games like Minecraft, MineTest and similar sandbox games. However due to how modular the design is, it has the potential to have a breadth of content that eclipses either of those two. Which is where this project comes in.GooeyDefence\nTower Defence is a very well known game genre, and one that is also consistently popular. This project aims to add a tower defence game mode to Terasology, with a sandbox spin on it. The game mode allows for modular tower building and freeform block placement. It is intended to show off the best of Terasology and thus is designed to be extremely extensible as well as to use content from other modules.\nThe original proposal can be seen hereHope you enjoy!",

PathwayMapper is a valuable tool for constructing pathways from scratch. One can also use it as a viewer to overlay cancer genomics data on existing \"template\" pathways like those that appeared in TCGA papers. Ultimately, this project has two main purposes.

To make the visualization of biocircuits more efficient and amenable to automation, my goal is to upgrade DNAplotlib to support highly customizable visualizations of genetic circuits from SBOL version 2 files. \nI will achieve this by integrating DNAplotlib with the pySBOL2 library to support reading and writing of SBOL2 files. The current DNAplotlib only support SBOL 1.0 documentation, and thus is only capable of manifesting DNA components consisted of DNA sequence and sequence annotation. It cannot represent complex interactions between different subcomponents, and thus has poor connectivity with other genetic platforms. Through my work this summer, DNAplotlib will (1) incorporate non-DNA components / partially complete design sequences (2) document and link to external models such as SBML and CellML (3) visualize hierarchical and modular biosystems (4) save customization into SBOL file.",

To address this issue, computer-readable formats and tools for modeling complex biological systems have been developed. Standards such as Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML) and tools like Systems Biology Simulation Core Library (SBSCL) can represent such complex biological models and numerically simulate them. But until now only a subset of these standards have been implemented in SBSCL. Essential features that will catalyze reproducibility, exchangeability, and reusability are lacking so far. Namely, i) implementation of full support for simulation experiments; ii) plots and visualization of simulation studies; iii) support for standard archive formats; iv) support for Open Source solvers, and v) support for hierarchical models.",

The current implementation of yt takes this data fills a global octtree, and then treats it similarly to that of AMR data.The disadvantage of this treatment of SPH data is that it is not intuitive to users, it is slow and it does not represent the underlying nature of the data.This project aims to develop a yt API for SPH data that ensures all SPH fields return data defined at the locations of the particles. Whilst this would provide a more intuitive way to interact with the data, it is still important to interpolate particle data onto grids, as this is essential in visualisation. This can be achieved by taking inspiration from SPLASH. Thus, at the end of the project SPH fields would be able to be visualised using a \"scatter\" (in technical details) approach, inspired by SPLASH. This would allow the the SPH fields to be interpolated efficiently onto grids.",

I collaborated with the mentor, Mike Innes to work on this and the code can be found in the ONNX.jl repository under FluxML organization.I will work on demos for the FluxJS.jl model zoo. This will make Machine Learning in Julia more dynamic and flexible, as it would help us in visualizing models in the browser.

The reason of this is that almost all Gensim models which support multithreaded training work in the following way. There is single job producer -- worker which reads the data and pushes the chunks into the job queue. Also, there are many job consumers -- workers which pull the chunks and update the model parameters in parallel.The problem is that consumers'  code is optimized well, so this leads to workers starvation problem. Job producer just can't fill the queue at such a high pace. This is the case even using fastest read the line, split it and yield corpus iterator.This problem could be solved by allowing users to pass K data streams (currently only single-stream == single job producer thread is supported), e.g. which point to K large files and use K job producers to fill the job queue.",

The model to be implemented is Zhang et al.'s (2017) model from their paper \"Towards end-to-end speech recognition with deep convolutional neural networks.\" Due to being implemented using only convolutional layers, this model will be lighter to train than previous models that have used heavier recurrent layers, while still achieving state-of-the-art performance.

The development of a new workman has already been initiated which needs to be completed for integration with the frontend. I propose to create a new frontend website for BioJS and to integrate it with the backend/middleware to get the data in the most optimized way. The website will be developed using VueJS which makes it easy to maintain and the website will merge the currently existing websites and produce a consistent and modern UI and a better UX.",

When we translate a format which does not include 3-D coordinate information into a format which requires it, we must predict coordinates. Open Babel implements a rule-based coordinate prediction method, but the current implementation is problematic. It sometimes fails when we treat inorganic and organometallic molecules, and by relying on force field geometry optimization, it is slower than distance-geometry or fragment-based methods.This is a proposal to implement a fast and efficient method to calculate 3-D coordinates using fragment information. Since fragments can decide the position of many atoms at once and minimize the need for conformer sampling, this approach is more efficient. P. Baldi's paper in 2013 reports that their fragment-based method is more accurate and 10 times faster than Open Babel. Implementing a better prediction method is beneficial for chemistry and leads to new discoveries in the field of drug design.",

Furthermore, benchmarking package was made to work with other motion planners in addition to OMPL and tutorials for the same were added.

A few examples in the literature use different approaches to the problem, and calculate the different spectrum of the light emitted at different phases of these oscillations. This is highly non-trivial: one cannot follow easily the single “heartbeat”, but needs to apply a strong de-noising to the signal first, and then calculate the average spectrum during the oscillation.",

Unlike\nLandsat images, Sentinel 2 datasets do not include thermal and Quality Assessment bands that simplify\nthe detection of clouds avoiding erroneous classification. At the same time, clouds shadows on the ground lead to anomalous reflectance values which have to be taken into account during the image processing.\nThe project aim is the coding of a specific module for GRASS GIS application which implements the procedure developed within my PhD research. The procedure allows to automatically identify clouds and their shadows in Sentinel 2 images applying some rules on reflectance values (values thresholds, comparisons between bands, etc.). These have been defined starting from rules found in literature and conveniently refined. Then the detection of shadows is improved using an adapted shape index. In order to increase the accuracy of the final results, a control check is implemented. Clouds and shadows are spatially intersected in order to remove misclassified areas. The final outputs are two different vector files (OGR standard formats), one for clouds and one for shadows.",

That makes possible to establish a connection without authentication making use of http and origin headers field of the client.

                    "content": "This project will explore extending a new feature for the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP). PCP is an open source framework at the system level that monitors, analyze and retrieve information to understand system performance. It has a distributed architecture of agents, called Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDA), that extract performance values from the desired environments or systems.Every agent (PMDA) reports to a centralized daemon called Performance Metric Collection Daemon or PMCD per host. Then, accessing any metric is as easy as sending a request to PMCDs. PCP has several client tools to help the final user understand the metrics. Finally, PCP also offers a good API to create an agent for any software.Coming back to the interest of the proposal, PCP also supports instrumentation. This is a way to enable user applications like Firefox to send metrics in execution time to the PMDA. In this scenario, Memory Mapped Values (MMV) are used to offer an extremely lightweight mechanism for instrumenting applications using shared memory. However, there is no support for metadata labels added since the newest v4, and hence the goal of this project: add label support for instrumentation.",

Since PCP metadata and data keys are distributed across potentially many Redis servers, Redis nodes need to communicate with one another for data access/transfer. Communication between Redis nodes (Redis clients with the Redis servers) is carried out by protocol called RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol). As Redis protocol (RESP) and the pmproxy'd PCP protocol can co-exist, the main goal of this project is extending pmproxy to support RESP such that an arbitrary Redis client can access the distributed key store using the direct key-to-server mapping mechanism used by the existing PCP time series code. Sub-goals include integrating libuv library with pmproxy. libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O.",

And the Django version will be upgraded to the latest TLS version, which is now 1.11. There will be no html file in the backend project. Front-end and back-end applications will use restful apis to exchange data.In addition, the backend project will have an admin module. Only administrators of the PG Performance Farm project can log in to the admin module. In the admin module, the administrator has the ability to modify the machine's submission rights, send registration confirmation emails, and so on.",

The traditional approach in RDBMS world involves doing an expensive ALTER TABLE operation, slow upgrade of an existing data, and stuff like this. This approach is often slow and inconvenient for application developers.\nTo solve this issue PostgreSQL provides JSON and JSONB datatypes. Unfortunately JSONB has a disadvantage of storing all documents keys, which is a lot of redundant data.\nOne possibility to to reduce JSONB redundancy is to use zson extension. It compresses JSONB documents using shared dictionary of common strings that appear in all or most documents. This approach has its limitations though. Particularly, since data schema evolves, the dictionary has to be updated from time to time. Also zson can affect the build-in mechanism of PostgreSQL of compressing data using PGLZ algorithm since this mechanism uses some heuristics to recognize data that compresses well. Thus sometimes zson can reduce the overall performance.\nThe idea of this project is to create an extension that provides Thrift support which solves zson problem.",

For nonrigid image registration, it implements a Symmetric Normalization framework. The major goal of this framework is to calculate an affine or deffeomorphic transformation to register two 2D images or 3D volumes. As a well-known problem, registration is a non-convex optimization problem. It is very important to initialize as close to the solution as possible. So in order to avoid getting stuck at local optima, it uses a multi-resolution strategy by building a Gaussian Pyramid. That is to say we can register our images in as many stages as we want, providing previous results as initialization for the next. As this way, we need to do a lot of iterations, thus it slow down the optimization process.\n    To speed up the calculation, one solution is to convert to a parallel computing algorithm. The OpenMP API supports multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming in C/C++ and Fortran. So in this project, I will implement a multi-thread algorithm using OpenMP to improve the performance of nonrigid image registration in DIPY.",

The most common model for water diffusion in tissue is the diffusion tensor (DT), which assumes a Gaussian distribution. This assumption of Gaussian diffusion oversimplifies the diffusive behavior of water in complex media, and is known experimentally to break down for relatively large b-values. DT derived indices, such as mean diffusivity or fractional anisotropy, can correlate with major tissue damage, but lack sensitivity and specificity to subtle pathological changes. \nMicrostructure Imaging of Crossing (MIX) is versatile and thus suitable to a broad range of generic multicompartment models, in particular for brain areas where axonal pathways cross.Multicompartment models (assess the variability of diffusion in sub-voxel regions) enable the estimation of more specific indices and so potentially give much greater insight into tissue architecture.Goal of Model Fitting: Identify which model compartments are essential to explain the data and parameters that are potentially estimable from a particular experiment and compare the models to each other using the BIC.",

The current R packages have limitations of using simple methods like linear models or propensity score matching to estimate average treatment effects in the population or at subgroup levels, which ignores the heterogeneity in the large observed data. Besides, these packages only focus on point-in-time estimates. We fill in the gap and provide a more comprehensive Bayesian nonparametric method for analyzing individual treatment effects on modern EHR data that are usually irregularly sampled time sequences and exposed to treatments multiple times.",

So far we have been able to create numerous quality checks, work-flows, analyses and visualization functionalities in the taxonomical, spatial and temporal aspects. But all these remain as standalone components without much synchronization or connectivity.

As per today, no work has been done now which includes multimodality into account (especially audio ) to determine the kind of activities and scenes that person is involved when it comes to egocentric perception. I have already built an audio-based model based on popular IEEE-DCASE-challenge which can successfully classify scenes into categories like ( person is walking in a park, driving in a car ) for egocentric views. I plan to extend my work as part of gsoc-2k18 to incorporate my model with video-based models and increase the scope of model from scenes to scenes+activities. The final breakdown of the steps is submitted in the pre-proposal attached above. The idea is to built pyscene-detect for egocentric videos,  which would be a prominent contribution owing to growing research in the area of first person view  videos.",

This provides to the robot all the information needed to predict its short-term environment and react better than a robot without this technology (it could look less human, it couldn't know about its probable near future so it couldn't react to it). That is to say, if a person passes in front of the robot, probably, it can't know it to react and border the person, because it is an unpredictable event. But, with this technology, if a human crosses ahead, the robot detects a change in its environment and it can change its path to not collide with the human. I have used RoboComp before and I know that it is a good software that can be greatly improve with this system.",

This forms a basis for future integration with RTEMS' existing libbsd codebase to enable TCP/IP, USB, SD, support.The x86_64-rtems-tools have been tested with a stub port and patched up as needed in prep for this port, leaving the port as the primary focus for the program.",

Much of the number theory can be viewed as the study of rational point of algebraic varieties. Some of the great achievements of number theory amount to determining the rational points on particular curves.\nFor example, Fermat’s last theorem is equivalent to the statement that for an integer n ≥ 3, the only rational point of the curve xn+yn=zn in P2 over Qare the obvious ones.  Common variants of these question include determining the set of all points of V(K) of height up to some bound.

The traditional loss-based TCP algorithms like TCP CUBIC, reduce their sending rates greatly when detecting packet loss, and increase rates conservatively when no packets loss happens. However, it is hard to estimate the network condition just on basis of one metric, i.e, packet loss. As a consequence, loss-based TCP algorithms underutilize network during most of the time, but cause severe congestion occasionally.TCP BBR is a new variation of TCP algorithm which adjusts its sending rate based on the real-time network metric, i.e, packet round trip time (RTT), the delivered rate (goodput). It is optimal that the amount of traffic walking through a network link is just equal to the well-known bandwidth delay production (BDP). Hence, TCP BBR uses RTT and goodput to constrict the amount of traffic in flight is equal to BDP. In this way, TCP BBR can maximize the goodput, and minimize the RTT at the same time.As a high-performance network stack, it is very important for Seastar to provide such high-performance TCP algorithm to further upgrade the performance.",

In the past, this data has been classified using a formula based on elevation angle, which is not always reliably available, or using another formula based on doppler velocity and spectral width which is biased to miscategorize low-velocity ionospheric backscatter (IS) as ground scatter (GS). Recently, researchers successfully applied machine learning techniques to this data. These approaches improved on past methods, but they used a very limited set of features and relied on simple machine learning methods that do not easily capture non-linear relationships or subtle probability distributions. This project applies machine learning methods with a focus on using a larger number of well-selected features and using more nuanced algorithms. The resulting Github toolkit provides combinations of DBSCAN and GMM for classifying SuperDARN data, along with various plotting tools. This project will continue after the summer, and I plan to add details on validation and try new algorithms.",

However, none of them is compatible with HPX and spawns own threads for parallel work execution. This is against the general HPX architecture and detrimental to the performance.With the HPX backend the parallel algorithms from OpenCV will be effectively executed by the HPX parallel_for loop and therefore chunked into HPX tasks and distributed between (existing) HPX worker threads.

Temperament refers to the process of altering the size of an interval by making it narrow or wide as compared to the pure form. Different types of temperament include equal, just intonation and meantone. Currently music blocks is limited to equal temperament only. This project aims to enhance the credibility of music blocks to all the three major types of tuning systems. Freeing Music Blocks from equal temperament will allow learners to understand music in more than one way. Above that the user can also create their own tuning system.",

This Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project aims to add ARM support for both the dynamic analysis framework DRAKVUF and the virtual machine introspection (VMI) library libvmi. The idea is to base our project upon the result of an earlier GSoC project which added altp2m support for Xen on ARM. The altp2m subsystem defines different views on the guest’s physical memory and allows to dynamically switch among them. With altp2m and DRAKVUF we are able to build a stealthy VMI framework. In summary, the goal of the GSoC project is to add support for DRAKVUF for ARM and thus provide more options for reverse engineering on the ARM architecture.",

This will be achieved in multiple parts.",

This will be useful later, when the input events need to be reconciled.Touch input events will be recorded using the getevent tool. Simple touches and gestures will be differentiated. Only events that are contained within the layout area will be processed by the system.Since getevent isn't reliable for keypress input, it cannot be used. Instead, an IME that logs text input will be implemented. This reduces logical complexity by not having to parse getevent logs for keyboard input, when keyboard layouts can vary wildly.The input events will be reconciled with the UI, by performing the input actions on the innermost element that the X and Y values of the input were contained within.Interactions can be sent to droidbot either as a script, or by directly deserializing the UTG class.",

Gradle is a general purpose build system and uses Groovy, a JVM language, to create flexible and highly customizable build workflows. To achieve this goal, my strategy is to have a working Gradle build coexisting with the current Ant script. Ant targets will migrate to Gradle tasks in an incremental and iterative process.

Given a program, we first run JSF to collect its post-state(p) by symbolic execution with the given pre-condition. Then we check if p entails the given post-condition(p'). If not, a bug is detected. Our approach to program repair has two main components: abduction and repair specification inference. First, we propose to infer the missing information to establish the post-condition through abduction using an existing solver. In particular, we infer a constraint f such that p * f is satisfied and p * f |-> p'. Secondly, based on abduction, we symbolically execute the input program with the abduction in a backward manner in order to construct repair specifications at every line of the input program. These repair specifications help to infer valid Hoare-style triples with fix candidates.",

But net-next-nuse has not kept pace with latest versions of Linux kernel. This has been the major hindrance for DCE to use latest Linux kernel. An active alternative to LibOs is Linux Kernel Library (LKL), which provides similar features of LibOs and supports latest Linux kernel versions.

Some of the promising new solutions rely on Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) (RFC 3168) to notify TCP endpoints of congestion that may be developing in a bottleneck queue, without resorting to packet drops. As a result, there have been attempts at Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to extend the functionality of ECN and provide rich feedback to TCP endpoints. In this regard, Accurate ECN feedback (AccECN) and ECN++ are two active topics of discussion at IETF. This project proposal is to: extend the ECN implementation in ns-3 to support AccECN and ECN++, test the correctness of implementation and provide examples.",

Thanks to Wine, lots of Windows software with no known alternative to other platforms can be run and used as is. This even allows for Windows games to run on Linux, an area which still suffers in terms of title availability. As Wine development continues, monitoring performance of different 3D titles can become a time consuming task with no standard results due to different gameplay each time a user play-tests a game. Some scripts that monitor performance already exist for some old titles. The purpose of this project is to pick some more recent games that offer a benchmark mode and write scripts that configure, run the benchmark and read the results. Newer titles are more of a challenge for today's systems (and Wine) and should provide us with clear results regarding any performance improvements between Wine revisions.",

In the latest version of Webpack 4, several improvements like new plugin system and parallelization with cache with UglifyJs have been implemented and accomplish a considerable performance enhancement. In this project, some cores and dependencies of Webpack are re-implemented in Rust, a low-level language, and WebAssembly binary is generated from them with the corresponding compilers. Some automation tools are used to help to convert existing JavaScript sources as well as future works to other languages. At the same time, backward compatibility of earlier Node.js versions will be maintained.

The first project in my proposal is to solve this by working in our Swagger/OpenAPI docs until we have a 100% documented REST API. The relevant code examples will also be updated so we can provide fully functional scripts that show how to use it, as well as extending our Python bindings to cover all the endpoints the API provides.The role that API keys play is also quite important, especially now that our integrations system is becoming more and more robust and we have many different clients for interacting with Zulip.\nThat's why having multiple API keys per user could be very useful in terms of user account security and convenience. The second part of my project consists in implementing this feature in Zulip's backend, so normal users can have as many API keys they consider necessary (e.g. one per client), keeping authentication tokens isolated between applications.",
