A system can be considered complex when its consisted of more sub-systems and when nonlinear interactions between its various design parameters and sub-systems are present. Optimizing such systems can be a challenge for human designers who can neither directly identify optimal design points nor manualy investigate a large design space to identify optimal solutions. In order to tackle this problem, algorithmic optimization approaches are required. Genetic algorithms can successfully navigate a large and nonlinear design space but their performance is highly dependent on the selection of various hyper-parameters. At its current form the optimization problem is concerned with the design of an electric propulsion unit for small satellites. This project aims in the development of visualization tools that will aid in better understanding such complex optimization processes. By developing visualization tools for the optimization process and the sub-systems' characteristics the algorithm's performance can be further enhanced and new insights that can prove valuable for human designers can be identified.",

The \"Knowledge, reasoning and planning\" section and “Uncertain knowledge and Reasoning” section was partially implemented last year. Implementation of the “Learning” section is not initialized yet. Therefore, as a part of my GSoC proposal, I plan to implement the Learning section of the textbook. Depending on the advice from the mentor, I would also be interested in making APIs for the Knowledge, reasoning and planning and Uncertain knowledge and reasoning sections of the textbook for AIMA4e branch. I also plan to add the explanatory notebooks for these sections.

This will be better than HomeAssistant in Raspberry Pi. Pi is a low powered device. Compared to that, amahi works on a full-fledged PC. So, it will give more power to users to control their devices. \nI will also implement amahi 12 in Fedora 30 using anaconda addon, which is in PYTHON.If time left then I propose to improve the installation experience of Amahi by completely removing the method of INSTALL CODE and setting up basic Amahi HDA without an API key.\nThis will remove the hassle of registration before using Amahi.Since, I have worked with Amahi before, especially with installing and setting up Amahi division. I have deep knowledge of how Amahi gets set up.\nI have done extensive app testing in my previous GSoC so, I have some knowledge of Amahi Apps.",

Among its tools are a shader generator, which mutates a shader program into variants that differ in machine code, but render a similar image to the original - and a shader reducer, which reduces shader code to focus on specific logic that a user is interested in. Used in tandem, these tools allow one to fuzz test shader compilers for flaws and easily reproduce them.The generator mutates a shader by performing \"transformations\" on the original code which complicate control/data flow. These transformations often make use of OpenGL's built-in functions and features to mutate expressions into equivalent forms.However, the generator and reducer are only aware of a subset of the OpenGL shader language, and do not support all of OpenGL's built-in math and transformation functions. This reduces the number of potential mutations and ultimately hampers GraphicsFuzz's capability of finding edge cases.This project aims to enhance GraphicsFuzz's support for OpenGL semantics and extend its capabilities with new transformations, then apply them to open-source drivers.",

Then we need to write consistent tests to validate different models and fields. Finally, an NFSW image classifier. Eventually, we will end up with cleaner code, sound application architecture of both frontend and backend, adding more tests and developing/revamping new features are the most obvious ones.

This most commonly appears as pronoun resolution where we need to identify the antecedent in the source context. Apertium works with resource-poor languages and the information available isn’t as linguistically complex as parse trees. Hence there is a need for a tool which resolves anaphora using simple linguistic information.Instead of the current system, which chooses a default male for pronoun resolution, this tool will use linguistic features to assign saliency scores to the possible antecedents. The highest scored antecedent is picked for possessive, reflexive, zero pronouns and long-distance relations like agreement in adjectives. This formalism is language agnostic and the features make use of only POS tags and basic gender and number information. I will test it on Spanish, Catalan, English, Russian, French, etc.When implemented, this tool will increase the fluency and intelligibility of the Apertium Translation Output of any pair it is used with. It has several interesting future prospects, such as using language specific linguistic features, and general coreference resolution.",

This will aid in making traditional helicopters safer to operate, reducing the risk of harm/damage to people, property, and the unmanned vehicle itself.\nMy secondary goal is to develop the functionality without loss of generality, maintaining its applicability to all helicopters.\nContained within this proposal is a review of previous work done by others.  Following this, preliminary investigations show that main rotor head momentum is a critical factor.  A methodology is proposed to scale a generic velocity trajectory using the main rotor head momentum in hover.  The trajectory will be empirically determined through SITL and real-life testing.  The resulting flight mode will provide a robust approach to completing an autorotation manoeuvre for any helicopter.  An overview plan of how development time will be allocated, over the GSoC period, is presented.  Finally, a short section detailing my background follows.",

A major deliverable of this project would be the addition of a UI based parameter handling module with incremental search capabilities. With a recent increase in the number of users, academic researchers and developers working on swarms and multi-vehicle simultaneous control; a new module providing a few high-level commands to all the vehicles or to individual vehicles with a GUI based environment can potentially serve as a good addition to the GCS.",

Most of the Click boards use the common protocols like SPI,I2C or UART to communicate with the Beaglebone and thus the support for them now is accomplished via device tree overlays via the bb.org-overlays repository. This requires /boot/uEnv.txt to be modified to load the drivers at boot, requiring at least one reboot to enable the support in a potentially error-prone way.The Greybus Simulator is a tool which simulates an AP Bridge, SVC, and an arbitrary set of modules plugged into Greybus. Greybus already provides most of the interfaces used on click boards and utilises manifest files to enumerate hardware at run-time.This project aims to enable Click Board Support via Greybus Simulator by writing suitable Manifests according to the Click board Specifications and by simply copying the manifest to a hotplug-directory a click board can be loaded,which would make the interfacing a lot easier.",

Utilizing std::variant, we can reduce the memory used by a real number to that of either a real_operation, real_explicit, or real_algorithm. I propose to better the way Real deals with operations, in particular, by simplifying sums of multiples of the same number.

For better expression evaluation I will use  Boost.YAP, a C++14 and later expression template library. Boost.YAP already offers a lot of functions and algorithms for dealing with expressions. It will ease my task moreover most of the issues pointed out in the paper cited above are efficiently handled by YAP.

In particular, turning models of human history into evolutionary models is notoriously time-consuming and bug-prone, and it requires knowledge of the specifics of each simulation tool. The major goals of this project are to develop a library of widely used historical models that integrate across multiple simulation tools, and to develop more robust and user-friendly model specification tools to automate the workflow of genomic and evolutionary analyses.",

Our main goal here is to train a deep learning model in python using all of its symptoms for the prediction of early onset of sepsis. Depending upon the values fed into the application, a doctor should get a good idea whether a person is susceptible to sepsis and get an early alert which can be critical for diagnosis. The application should be able to make these predictions using only a minimal set of streaming physiological data in real-time. During the course of this project, new deep learning methods, using temporal convolutional neural networks or quasi RNN, a model will be developed to identify markers that predict the onset of sepsis in patients admitted to the intensive care unit.

Applications exist where the number of syllables spoken in an audio file can be extracted without processing the words themselves, resulting in much faster runtimes. By similarly analyzing the number of syllables in a chunk of text, a process for which several very good algorithms exist, we can roughly match the timestamp of each syllable in the audio file to the corresponding syllable in the lyrical text. This process would take place in a separate module than the actual SwagLyric application so as to facilitate speed of retrieval when the user is actually streaming. Several obstacles, which will be discussed in more detail, exist: these include stripping away background music and getting specific audio information from Spotify’s stream.",

This lack of freedom creates two problems: the first one is that it may reduce the productivity as cloud users have to learn a new tool they were not used to. The second one is that often times the application provided does not satisfy the requirements of users, and these are left performing an inefficient cycle of downloading a file from the cloud to the local computer, manipulate the file locally and uploading the file again to the cloud, dismissing the ubiquity pillar of cloud-based computing.It is in the goal of this proposal to prototype the concept of Bring Your Own Application and to demonstrate how to regain the right of freedom for cloud end-users",

A Kalman Filter is used both to reduce the impact of sensor noise on estimations, and to determine which sensors can be “trusted” more than others. Whereas more primitive methods for estimation and extrapolation rely on some form of averaging, a Kalman Filter forecasts by developing a weighted covariance for each sensor input.The aim of this project is to implement a Kalman Filter in Rust. Rust has gained popularity for providing more compile-time checks than other systems-level languages, namely C and C++. Rust’s memory model ensures that there is little to no room for many of the memory pitfalls common in other low level languages, such as double-freeing memory, dangling pointers, and user-after-free errors. This, in conjunction with high runtime performance, leads writing components of a codebase in Rust to be favorable for both speed and stability.",

For example, they can be used in terms of benchmarks to determine the variance of a processed geometry from a given ground-truth model.One such similarity measure is the Hausdorff distance. Given two compact subsets A, B of a metric space, the one-sided Hausdorff distance between A and B is defined as the distance between an element a from A and an element b from B, where a is chosen to maximize the distance and b is chosen to minimize it. Intuitively speaking, the Hausdorff distance measures the maximum deviation between two models.The project consists of implementing the algorithm for interactive Hausdorff distance computation presented by Tang, Lee, and Kim. While it provides an approximation to the Hausdorff distance - as already present in the CGAL framework - it ensures the computed measure to be within a user-specified error bound. Thereby, the user can obtain as good results as necessary for the applications at hand within a fast and efficient pipeline.",

In their method, they collapse vertices that share an edge or that are close to each other. In each iteration, a pair of vertices get collapsed resulting in a new vertex. They choose the pair that will be collapsed based on an error metric expressed as a quadratic function. They choose the pair that minimizes the error metric. A parallel version of Garland & Heckbert will also be implemented.After implementing this approach in CGAL, CGAL’s triangulated mesh simplification framework will be compared to other libraries in terms of runtime and memory usage.

Although OpenGR has a wrapper to work with CGAL types, it suffers from duplication of the point type due to lack of proper abstraction layer. For pointmatcher, there does not exist a wrapper, i.e., an interoperability channel to use its ICP method on a CGAL point cloud that global registration is applied. The first goal of this project is to introduce an abstraction layer around point and normal type for the OpenGR library, so that, CGAL types can be directly used. The second goal is to have a new wrapper for the pointmatcher library  that will provide an ICP method that can be applied after the global registration to a CGAL point cloud.",

If it issues no warnings, the code is guaranteed not to throw a NullPointerException at run time.My project will ensure the significant reduction of these NullPointerException(s) before they happen (by checking them at compile time) rather than relying on users to report them and fixing them.",

This can be followed by Implementation for templated patches and interactive diff behavior along with writing tests supporting these new functionalities.

Pipes have maximum size restriction, so there could be many pipes which results in memory pressure during pre-dump process. Replacing pipe-pages with userspace supplied buffer from CRIU will alleviate this memory pressure. Since, the buffer pages can be swapped out.Another issue is duration for which pre-dump algorithm freezes the target task. Use case like live migration expects smallest possible freezing glitch. So, objective is to reduce this freeze time during pre-dump.To achieve both of these objectives, we use process_vm_readv system call with a set of VMA-list gathered by freezing target task for minimal amount of time. There are challenges in handling memory areas with this approach, like race conditions resulting in false reads. Development of graceful solution for these challenges is objective of this project.",

SPARQL is a query language for RDF.Extracting data requires a query to be made in SPARQL and the response to the query is a link that contains the information pertaining to the answer or the answer itself. Accessing such data is difficult for a lay user, who does not know how to write a query. This project will try to make this humongous linked data available to a larger user base in their natural languages(now restricted to English). The primary objective of the project being to be able to translate any natural language(English) question to valid SPARQL query.",

Though the community has been generally going for speech and text output for these models, there has been far less certainty in the inputs. A large number of inputs have been taken for NLG systems including images, numeric data, semantic representations and Semantic Web (SW) data. Presently, the generation of Natural Language from  SW, more precisely RDF data, has gained substantial attention and has also been proved to support the creation of NLG benchmarks. However, most models are aimed at generating coherent sentences in English, whilst other languages have enjoyed comparatively less attention from researchers. RDF data is usually in the form of triples, \n. Subject denotes the resource, predicate denotes traits or aspects of the resource and expresses the relationship between subject and object.In this project we aim to create a multilingual Neural verbalizer, ie, generating high-quality natural-language text from sets of RDF triples in multiple languages using one stand-alone, end-to-end trainable model.",

It has attracted a lot of attentions in the research areas of natural language processing and information retrieval. Generally, it complete the analysis challenge via three steps: identifying named entities, detecting predicates and generate SPARQL queries. In these three steps, predicate detection, a core component of this process, identifies the KB relation(s) a question refers to. To build a predicate detection structure, we identify all possible named entity first, then collect all predicates corresponding to the above entities. What follows is to calculate the similarity between problem and candidate predicates using a Multi-granularity neural network model(MGNN). To find the globally optimal entity-predicate assignment, we use a joint model which is based on the result of entity linking and predicate detection process rather than considering the local predictions (i.e. most possible entity or predicate) as the final result.",

In this workflow, the goal is to detect similar concepts/classes or instances/individuals between the source and target ontology. There are two levels of linking, the first one is schema level linking and another one is instance level linking. Schema level linking is mapping/alignment between concepts/classes of the source and target ontology and on the other hand, instance level linking is mapping/alignment between instances/individuals of the source and target ontology.This proposal presents an approach for ontology alignment through the use of an unsupervised mixed neural network. In this workflow, we will explore reading and parsing the ontology and extracting all necessary information about concepts and instances, generating semantic vectors for each entity with different meta information like entity hierarchy, object property, data property, and restrictions and designing User Interface based system which will show all necessary information about the workflow.",

This GUI would allow controlled data points selection, massive rendering, data display, custom interaction, selection of fields for plotting and layout of widgets in the browser using Intake, Xarray and Pyviz collection of tools. Currently majority of geospatial data exploration happens in stand-alone applications like Panoply and NcView, tools that have limited functionality, do not provide complex analysis methods and can only be reasonably extended by the software developers on those projects. This new tool, written in Python, but presented as a dashboard in the notebook environment, will be extendable directly by researchers by using it in conjunction with tools like Dask and will also provide complex analysis methods on the data being visualized. It holds the promise of saving Earth Science and other researchers significant amounts of time since they can directly focus on visual data analysis and research rather than writing custom code to explore data.",

Accurately detecting whale sounds and correctly classifying them into corresponding whale pods are essential tasks, especially in the case when two or more species of whales vocalize in the same observed area. Most of the current tasks of whale sound detection and classification still need to be implemented manually.We aim to develop two deep learning models for the detection and pod-classification of orca, or killer whale, calls in unknown long audio samples. These deep neural networks will help identify and verify killer whale calls so that researchers, grad students, and shipping vessels don't have to. The end-user interface can be made as a web-app which can easily be used by scientists in their research.",

It can be used for image and video processing to make them clearer and it can be a preprocessing method for many computer vision systems. We propose to implement this technology in FFmpeg. For video, this proposal proposes to utilize the relationship between frames to remove rain and fog. For single image, we can use traditional methods, such as discriminative sparse coding, low rank representation and the Gaussian mixture model. And also some deep learning methods.",

Firstly, the project needs the development of the program modes in the Android application so that the user can select between the formers and get to launch the application and receive output/feedback accordingly. Then comes the development of the Audio and Visual Feedback features for the application. Now while developing these features it needs to get all the bases covered by coding all the possible classes (java files) and function modules for handling the background processes which can be achieved by taking some inspiration from the Neurophlex project. Animations need to be integrated and the app shall need UX/UI improvements for a better in-app experience. Details of the development process are further in my proposal.",

At the core of the app, we will still use the PSLab-python library for device communication. As Electron apps are developed using JS, we can expect a more enthusiastic developer crowd to join the cause. A much more thorough documentation for the same is also available.

To ease maintenance of this tools (adding new features, fixing bugs) the primary goal of my work is to create a single implementation, containing support for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks, where the code duplication will be eliminated and the functionality and output will be equal to the old implementations.

As mesh networks usually operate on unencrypted wireless connections, the attack vector is considerably big.Our solution is to combine the current cryptographic stack of BMX7 with the one used by WireGuard. The process via which this will be achieved will be iterative; meaning that first binary calls from bmx7 to userland WG will be introduced, afterwards the efforts will be centered in the creation of a new plugin implementing WireGuard routing by using part of the existing cryptographic primitives and at last the effort to combine the tunnel plugin with the wg one.The detail that distinguishes our approach’s difficulty from hard to medium is cryptographic keys. It’s simpler to announce new public keys for WireGuard and have a separate plugin than replacing the existing BMX7 keys to allow signing of descriptive updates and encryption of traffic.",

In my proposed plan, a new MPI framework ported from existing MPI applications is introduced to enable Gentoo to use multiple MPI versions and relevant packages depending on them (for example, HPL). The new MPI framework is mainly based on ‘Modules’ package together with Gentoo Prefix technique for detecting, choosing or manipulating MPI environment. Also, a new implementation of mpi.eclass is introduced and the packages can still be emerged normally onto the system without any trace of mpi.eclass being used. The approach also enables users to easily work with different implementations at the same time without any special privileges. In order to solve the defect that empi does not support multilib, the new framework also adds support for allowing the environment to be configured and installed into different places among different architectures (amd64, x86 etc.).",

This is a lot of information at once and is cluttered. So, I would be redesigning these APIs and would make it closer to RESTful principles.Now, variation search by 'geneId' is not efficient. To deal with this issue, I would build a data pipeline that would load mappings from a 'geneId' to its coordinates.

This difference results into limitations as to what operations can be performed with the current libgdata API. Since, each file’s identifier is its ID, i.e. “name” equals ID, we have to specifically use “display-name” for storing a file’s title, which is what is shown by nautilus.Simply copying/moving files from one folder to other folder results into an error “Operation not supported” so as to preserve the file’s title. Copying/Moving is one of the fundamental operations that should be possible on a file.

This project will enhance the software receiver to aid acquisition and tracking of BEIDOU B1C signals that would further expand the receiver's capabilities and would facilitate research on multi-constellation, multi-frequency receiver working with real signals. The demodulation of the B-CNAV1 navigation message of BEIDOU B1C will open the door to innovation in multi-constellation receivers.\nAlong with the fully functional implementation of a GNSS receiver working with BEIDOU B1C signals, this project will help to address topics such as integrity, reliability, robustness, enhanced coverage, and high-accuracy positioning. Additionally, the integration of BEIDOU B1C observables into the position, velocity, time (PVT) solutions will allow the achievement in a diverse range of applications and components.",

The performance obtained with such architectures is sufficient for benign propagation scenarios, but typically deliver poor performance under harsh propagation conditions. Code and carrier tracking, as well as joint code/carrier synchronization, can be formulated as an estimation problem which can be solved using Bayesian filtering methods. It has been shown in the GNSS literature that KF-based synchronization solutions can be used to overcome the performance limitations of standard approaches, offering implicitly adaptive filter bandwidth, and opening up the possibility of using nonlinear models to avoid certain limitations associated with the use of code, phase or frequency discriminators. In this contribution, we will leverage powerful nonlinear tracking algorithms, including cubature, unscented, and sigma point Kalman filters in order to produce realizations of carrier and joint code-carrier tracking blocks which promise to be more effective and adaptable in challenging GNSS environments when compared to traditional architectures.",

As we want to make hydrus reliable and complete, we will need to at least provide all the basic functionalities a Hydra-compliant API Documentation can describe. As we are planning to create a testbed in hydra-python-agent to test whether a server is Hydra compatible or not, it makes sense to first make hydrus compatible with Hydra so we can test it. So besides extending the functionality of hydrus, this project includes refactoring hydrus and making it completely compatible with Hydra specification.",

That said, in the last decades, great minds from  the W3C (Like Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web itself) are putting effort into creating standards and tools to make the data published to the web be easily processable, thus enabling Smart Clients.And that’s where Hydra comes in, Hydra is a W3C Draft that aims to provide a specification on how to write APIs documentation so it’s published in a structured and semantic way, enabling machines to understand these APIs. Hydra Ecosystem  is a community that aims to provide tools for the Hydra Specification come to life, using Python. Right now, there’s a steep learning curve into showcasing how Hydra benefits the web. That said, this project aims to deliver key features for the Hydra Ecosystem and work towards a web demonstration which makes easier for people to try these concepts.",

This project would aim to expand the data available for model validation and for query in PyOpenWorm. Expanding the data available would aid hypothesis generation in the C.elegans research community, by allowing fast access to past observations and by facilitating the generation of more robust models through model validation tests such as SciUnit. However, ultimately it could also be a poster child to inspire an increase in standardisation and statistical accountability in the publication of biological research as a whole. As an additional project, we will start work to create \"Standard Worm\" which will enable researchers to compare variability in experimental worms to a standard reference space.",

We then evolve neural networks inside vehicles using a Genetic Algorithm with an appropriate fitness function, and hope to observe some natural behavioural patterns as well as certain connectome motifs seen in nature. This would allow us to reproduce the very same behaviours’ simulation, as well as hypothesize on correspondence of connectome motifs to specific behaviours.

However, setting up an instance of Intermine is a time consuming and error prone process. It also requires technical knowledge and some familiarity with Java, Postgres and shell scripts. These issues create a barrier for entry and friction in the adoption of intermine by the bioinformatics community. To solve these problems, Intermine team is planning to create a cloud platform that offers managed Intermine instances. This will remove the technical burden from the user and greatly simplify the creation of intermine instances. Also, the work done on Intermine cloud can easily be translated to simplify the creation of Intermines locally.\nThis project forms a part of the Intermine cloud project. It includes packaging of intermine and it’s components in docker containers,  cloud infrastructure setup, orchestration of containers, authentication, and authorization on the cloud.",

The project will provide full control over how one wants to perform validation, a user can use the project’s rich API to customize the behavior of the library. It will provide a generic validation library that can be further extended for any number of file format, A user can even provide its own validation implementation if he/she customize the behavior of the library.",

Currently there exists two such tools - protovista and cytoscape-interaction-network-viewer. The BlueGenes ClojureScript application actually queries for all tools available before sending the report page to frontend and integrates the ones found. These tools are actually javascript applications following the specifications provided by the BlueGenes tool API and receive some initialisation input from BlueGenes like gene id in case of a gene report page.\nThe purpose of this project is to develop BlueGenes compatible visualisation tools which can help biologists and explorers have better insights via the report of a gene / protein on the report page.",

I propose developing a methodology to assess the quality of news sources, both in terms of bias/factual reporting and in terms of technical viability such as geoblocking, paywall blocks, and CAPTCHAs. I will then use this methodology to create a tool that can automatically assess quality and take an appropriate action, perhaps preserving an error message and reason for failure in the Wayback Machine. This tool will ideally be integrated with the Wayback Machine’s web crawlers. I will also use my findings to develop recommendations for circumvention tactics, such as paying for subscriptions to important news sources or negotiating agreements with CAPTCHA services to allow the Internet Archive, as a public good, to bypass the CAPTCHA. The goal of the project is to develop a system to think about the quality of archived webpages and then create tools to automate quality assessment.",

This will allow them to manage online dependencies much more easily.Task 2: support for Helm chart import\nThis will allow existing Helm users to import their charts into kapitan projects and render the charts together with the values set in the kapitan inventory to compile into a target. This integration will make it easy for users to switch to kapitan from Helm.Task 3: kapitan binary\nKapitan exists as a pip package to be used in CLI and as a Docker image. Users have pointed out that having a portable binary for Kapitan would be very helpful. This task aims to meet such needs by packaging kapitan into a static binary with the use of third-party build tools.Task 4: json schema validation for k8s\nKapitan, just as it has its own channel in k8s slack community, is used by a large number of k8s users.

In digiKam, tags on photos are strongly supported for the sake of providing users with a natural workflow of searching and arranging photos in their collections. Since many of our photos contain faces, face tag has apparently emerged as an essential property for any photos management software, also with the fact that user has to tag thousand of their photos manually. Being aware of that, digiKam team has put a lot of efforts to develop face engine, capable of scanning photos and suggesting face tags automatically basing on pre-tagged photos by users. However, that functionality is currently deactivated in digiKam, as it is slow while not adequately accurate. Thus, this project aims to improve the performance and accuracy of facial recognition in digiKam by exploiting state-of-the-art neural network models in AI and machine learning.",

SDDM used in conjunction with Plasma, however, results in certain issues, some of which fall under the guise of consistency between the login screen and the desktop. In practice this means that as soon as there is any relevant veering from Plasma defaults, the login manager no longer provides an identical visual experience. This GSoC project would try to solve that very issue by adding the possibility of syncing the desktop and login manager options. Options that could be synced are: color scheme, font, font size, font rendering, icon theme (obtained from the Plasma theme). Rather than adding discrete options, the suggestion is to have only one option that would pertain to syncing SDDM settings with a particular user’s settings. Patching SDDM to support Plasma wallpapers would also fall within the scope of the project. Most importantly, because desktop display scaling preferences are likewise not respected in SDDM, the project would also tackle the issue of allowing users to set a display scaling preference via GUI.",

So, instead of running whole GUI application (KDE Partition Manager) as root or superuser, a helper non GUI application is spawned which runs as root and executes privileged tasks. This helper program communicates with KDE Partition Manager over simple DBus protocol. The current implementation may seem a good idea, but is not, the reason being that KAuth is an extra layer added over Polkit-qt which causes extra overhead.\n So, the proposal for this project is to port all the authentication/authorization code from KAuth to Polkit-qt without effecting the original behaviour of KDE Partition Manager.",

Later, it will construct a bug report, that shows how the error can be reproduced. These steps (such as that the analyzer modeled a call to function, assumed a variable is positive, etc.) are collectively referred to as a bug path. Ideally, this contains every information needed to reproduce the error, but is minimal. However, it can contain either too little or too much information.In my proposed project, I indent to use static backward program slicing to enhance bug report generation. Instead of doing a fix-point algorithm on the control flow graph (CFG) though, my solution would be implemented on the abstract syntax tree (AST). This solution would only be an estimation, so I only propose to add more information to the bug reports, and research whether program slicing could be used for bug path shortening as a followup work.",

This is true both in standard compilation but also link-time-optimization (LTO) in which the module is (partially) merged with others in the same project at link time. LTO is able to take advantage of this to optimize functions calls to outside the translation unit. Code compiled without LTO for all of its dependencies, however, does not have this information and therefore is unable to perform such optimizations. To remedy this issue, one might propose always compiling programs with LTO enabled. This doesn’t solve the problem for two reasons of practicality: LTO comes with a nontrivial compile-time investment; and many libraries upon which a program could depend, do not ship with LTO information, simply headers and binaries. In this project, we propose solving the problem by generating annotated versions of the source code that also include this derived information. Such an approach has the benefits of both worlds: allowing optimizations previously limited to LTO without running LTO and only providing headers.",

If we could infer them, more optimization would be done.\nIn addition to this, there are a lot of problems in current implementation. First of all, each algorithm is very similar but implemented separately. If we extend these implementations to infer other attributes, there would be a lot of code duplication and it is hard to maintain consistency. Therefore, it is better to replace them with a more designed implementation. We have a new framework for deducing attribute called “Attributor” developed by Johannes Doerfert.

Also, I find C++ is much better suited for creating ergonomic and easy to use libraries than C, obviously.

To avoid this, we can select the functions ahead of time which are likely going to execute next and compile them speculatively, using runtime profiles from previous app executions and/or static program analysis.It helps to use leverage the performance of Just-in-time compilation using modern multi-core machine.

Multi-objective optimization has been applied in many fields of science where optimal decisions need to be taken in the presence of trade-offs between two or more conflicting objectives.I propose a project where I implement a NEAT framework and use it to optimize single-objective functions within ensmallen. Besides this, I will implement a framework for multi-objective optimization within ensmallen along with a multi-objective optimizer, Unified NSGA-III.

In these cases, this means that a user would only be able to hear a preview of the melody and nothing else. Unless the user is an experienced professional with strong audiation skills, being unable to physical hear the harmony of their music is an important setback.This project aims to implement the playback of chord symbols in a flexible way to suit different styles and genres of music and be versatile for use with final scores as well as unfinished drafts.

But the built in Nvim TUI cannot show the screen of a remote Nvim server. The goal of this project is to bring this functionality to Neovim.The aim of the project can be summarized as: Whenever the user starts Nvim asnvim --connect {addr}the Nvim will connect to the Nvim server running at {addr}, where {addr} is either a pipe or a tcp address. The Nvim client instance would send input to the remote Nvim server and reflects the UI of the remote Nvim server. So the Nvim client acts like any other external GUI.Thus, this project makes TUI an RPC client. This enables us to convert nvim from a multi-threaded process, where TUI and nvim server ran on separate threads, to a multi-process system with TUI and the server running as separate processes and interacting with each other using the RPC API (MessagePack) of nvim.",

BARTs are useful and flexible model to capture interactions and non-linearities and have been proved useful tools for variable selection.Bayesian Additive Regression Trees will allow PyMC3 users to perform regressions with a “canned” non-parametric model. By simple calling a method, users will obtain the mean regressor plus the uncertainty estimation in a fully Bayesian way. This can be used later to predict on hold-out data.

Model comparison is not trivial because of the different structures and number of parameters of each model. Fortunately, there are some information criteria (i.e. leave-one-out cross-validation) that can be used for this task. Even though convergence is proven for infinite iterations, it is not the case for finite MCMC runs, which can be arbitrarily bad. Convergence assessment must take into account both intra- and inter-chain correlations.ArviZ implements many of these algorithms for diagnostic and comparison, at least at a preliminary level, but it still lacks plots and tools to ease and improve its interpretation.

In this project, I will provide C++ implementations of RNN models (LSTM, GRU). This will bring the fast speed of ChainerX to RNN models. I aim to replicate all RNN-related chainer ops in ChainerX.

It’s clear that the current method of representing genomes is not ideal.\nThere is a need for a representing the reference in a data structure that contains its inherent variation. Different methods have been tried and the variant graph is a promising one. The way the graph works is by representing the variation within the genome as alternative paths one can traverse the graph through and conserved regions as nodes without alternative paths to the get to the next node; we then index the nodes for querying and alignment.\nMoreover, variation graphs hold an advantage with rapidly evolving genomes and short read data that could get thrown out when it doesn’t have a place to align to in the reference; with the variant graph short reads should reads could align to alternative nodes.",

Open Babel’s coordinate generation function was improved in speed and stereochemical accuracy by the new fragment-based coordinate generation method implemented as a GSoC 2018 project. However, the stereochemistry accuracy is not as high as the distance geometry method of RDKit.In this project, I will improve the coordinate generation of Open Babel by implementing a new method which combines the fragment-based method of Open Babel and the distance geometry method of RDKit. This new implementation is expected to be faster than current RDKit and more accurate in stereochemistry than current Open Babel. Implementing a better prediction method could be beneficial for a wide range of applications such as drug design.",

As a result, it is difficult to obtain a unified result, with all the desired features and many people, who lack a computer science background, are excluded from using them.\nThe goal of the project is to build an online web GUI, that provides its users with an easy way to extract quantitive text profiles from multilingual texts. The text analysis will come from scripts that combine many existing NLP packages, written in many programming languages, like R's udpipe or Python's spaCy. The tool is going to be modular and open source, in order to be easily accessible and adaptable to everyone's needs. The project is going to boost and facilitate scientific research in NLP fields, as it will make text analysis available to people with little to none computer science knowledge (e.g. linguistics students).",

To accelerate UI development, QML provides the Qt Quick Controls module with ready made widget types, each supported by a C++ class, like Button or Switch, ready to be styled and modified at our project needs. The module is currently on version 2.4 but there is no support for Calendar in the latest version, to be more specific, the Calendar was lastly provided in version 1.4 of the Qt Quick Controls module that was released with the Qt 5.3 version.Expected ResultsThe Qt Calendar widget is updated, modified accordingly and ported into Qt 5.12 and Qt Quick Controls 2 current version following the QtQC2 module standards and supporting all features like styling. The Calendar, ideally would have a Template type where from properties like background and/or contentItem can be set for style customisation & switching support. Also, it should be possible to be instantiated as a standalone QML type and be styled locally for regular usage.",

Using deep learning models for super resolution is a widely researched area, as they generally achieve better accuracy than classical computer vision based algorithms. There are many popular type of models used, ranging from supervised learning to unsupervised learning methods. I propose to implement two deep learning based models to be a part of the OpenCV library. One is EDSR, which is a residual network based model, and is known for it’s high accuracy. The other one is LapSRN, which is a fast, but still accurate model, that can be deployed to real-time applications.

In recent years, OpenStreetMap has gained a large number of Wikidata tags, and the information from the Wikidata database should improve the importance rankings and search results from Nominatim. To accomplish this objective, it will be necessary to create a script that can process a Wikidata dump and extract the information that would be useful to Nominatim, then import the data it into the Nominatim database. Nominatim already uses Wikipedia links to improve search results, and where Wikidata is available it can help determine the correct Wikipedia link that should be used whenever a Wikipedia link does not exist for an OSM object. This can be done both by directly matching objects to their Wikipedia links via Wikidata, and also by ensuring that links are made to the correct type of object and that links are not made to vague pages such as those that describe brands or other information that is not relevant to search result ranking.",

It has an average running time of O(|E|) on random graphs and the same worst-case complexity as Bellman-Ford's algorithm of O(|V| x |E|).Boost::Breadth First Search is the implementation of the classic Breadth First Algorithm in the Boost Graph Library. It is a basic graph traversal algorithm which can be applied to any type of graph. One of its various applications is to find the path with minimum edges from a given source to an arbitrary destination. It has a linear time complexity of O(|V| + |E|).Binary Breadth First Search is a modification of the standard Breadth First Search algorithm and can calculate single-source shortest paths in a weighted graph where weights of all edges are either zero or some constant C. It has a linear time complexity of O(|V| + |E|) compared to O(|E| + |V| log |V|) of Dijkstra’s algorithm.I propose to add the above three algorithms to pgRouting during the GSoC period.",

There would be 3 basic types of metrics: counter, duration and gauge. Agent is to be build with modular architecture in mind with an option of changing implementation of both aggregator and parsers, which will allow to accurately describe differences between approaches to aggregation and text protocol parsing. Since the PMDA API is based on around callbacks the design has to be multithreaded.Agent is to be fully configurable with either PCP configuration options and/or separate configuration file. Writing integration tests is also in the scope of the project.",

The GWR model in PySAL can currently estimate Gaussian, Poisson and Logistic models though the MGWR model is currently limited to only Gaussian models. This project aims to expand the MGWR model to nonlinear local spatial regression modeling techniques where the response outcomes may be discrete (following a Poisson distribution) or binary (Logistic models). Subsequently, to support efficient testing for different model implementations, a simulated data generator module will be implemented to supply test datasets following unique model variable distribution needs. This will also provide a foundation for possible expansion to test other local model implementations in PySAL. Additionally, since the functionality to predict the dependent variable at unsampled locations is not supported for the MGWR model in PySAL, this project also aims to enable predictions for MGWR.",

I will explain the models from these libraries using an implementation of Grad-CAM​ (https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391), a widely applicable and robust approach for highlighting what contributed to a prediction. In the case of image-based networks, a heat map will be created indicating where the network looked to make a prediction, of which there are many examples online.

By design, it will also provide a chat facility for the users who are collaborating on the project. Its UI would be a part of msui, the core User Interface module of mss.

This process, when done properly, takes a large portion of a researcher’s time when it would be better spent on doing the actual analysis. By developing a package that automates much of the data import, cleaning, filtering and standardization process, a substantial fraction of the researcher’s time will be saved, while automating a significant portion of the data gathering and management aspect of asset pricing research. We expect this last aspect to support the reproducibility of research by academics and financial professionals. Our over-arching goal is to make the EAPR package an ideal support tool for the wide range of asset pricing research as described in Ball, Engle, and Murray (2016), and for quantitative portfolio construction research. The initial version of the package will work very effectively with asset prices, returns and factors (exposures) data delivered by Wharton Research Data Services, a major source of empirical data for academic asset pricing researchers.",

Furthermore, the package will compute confidence intervals for the parameter estimates, and hypothesis tests concerning the parameters. Due to the complexity of the AST and GAT distributions, and the desire to use them in empirical asset pricing studies with large cross-sections (e.g., 1000 to 5000 stocks), we plan to use the Rcpp package to integrate C++ code to obtain high-performance MLE computations.",

However, in practice, we usually have examples of periods of time where we know no changes should be present, or conversely where changes are expected to exist. When and where such information is available, we can potentially use this to aid our judgement of how to set complexity penalties in the changepoint estimation task, and thus, decide on an appropriate number of changepoints, a task which currently requires time-consuming parameter tuning by domain experts.In this particular project, we seek a simple visualization interface to support, i) human labeling of the data with the aid of several complementary measures on the data-stream such as as mean, trends, min, max, variance, etc. and ii) interactive exploration of the result space suggested by a changepoint detection algorithm.

Currently, this methods are used widely and their applications include disease risk mapping, climate change risk predictions, conservation biology, among others. Physiological data suggests that Grinnellian niches are convex in nature and they may probably have an ellipsoidal form when multiple dimensions are considered. However, among the available software in the field, algorithms to model ecological niches as ellipsoids in the environmental space are scarce. Several analyses, not currently available, can be performed assuming ellipsoidal niches, especially if recent  literature is considered.

This is because “R was purposely designed to make data analysis and statistics easier for you to do. It was not designed to make life easier for your computer”. Although there are several R interpreters that attempt to improve execution speed, “switching interpreters is something to consider carefully”.“Beyond performance limitations due to design and implementation, it has to be said that a lot of R code is slow simply because it’s poorly written. Few R users have any formal training in programming or software development. This means that it’s relatively easy to make most R code much faster”. “A good deal of work is going into making R more efficient. Much of this work consists of reimplementing interpreted R code”.The main goal of this project is to provide an R package with functions that allow users to automatically apply strategies to optimize their R code. The developed functions will have as input and output R code so that the resulting code will allow the user to understand what modifications in the code cause its optimization.",

First, there is a need to implement some more random walks so we can choose which to use with respect to our problem, e.g. ratio of dimensions / constraints. Such a choice is important, because the sampling is the bottleneck of the proposed algorithms, so it must be as efficient as possible. Second, use these sampling methods to solve convex optimization problems and the redundancy problem. I propose a variety of randomized algorithms, such as one that uses cutting planes and one that uses simulated annealing. In the end, I will provide support for linear programming, semidefinite programming and mixed integer linear programming. A good part of the project will be testing to provide empirical data, since some of these algorithms perform better in practice than predicted by theory.",

The package volesti is a c++ software with an R interface being the first package providing such a variety of options in geometric statistics. It currently scales to a few hundreds dimensions and hence it could be an essential tool for a quite large number of scientific applications. However, the possibility to scale from a few hundred to a few thousand dimensions was considered as a very far-reaching goal for many years. The goal of this project is to provide the first ever implementations for sampling from convex polytopes and volume computation in a few thousand dimensions. We exploit some very recent theoretical results that guarantee fast convergence and numerical stability in order to propose an efficient implementation of the current state-of-the-art geometrical random walk algorithms. The proposed implementations will be a decisive contribution to other scientific fields as computational geometry, finance and optimization.

The advantage of tCNN is that it uses the convolutional kernel to capture the signals of microbiome species with a close evolutionary relationship in a local receptive field. Moreover, tCNN uses the different convolutional layer to capture different taxonomic rank (e.g. species, genus, family, etc). Together, the convolutional layers with its built-in convolutional kernels capture microbiome signals at different taxonomic levels while encouraging local smoothing induced by the phylogenetic tree. ‘tCNN’ is implemented in user-friendly R package based on TensorFlow.",

In RoboComp, when robots need to perform complex tasks, its behaviour is based on missions. The mission begin from an initial state and through different transitions reaches a final state, that is, the robot completes the mission. The states are represented by a graph. \nMy proposal is to use a JSON structure to store this graph. This allows its storage as a collection of documents in MongoDB. Consequently, each document could represent a state of the robot. Also, this slot is intended to study the viability of Neo4J for this purpose, as far as I am concerned, the best option would be to use the polyglot persistence, that consists in to use the database best suited for the type of data, in our case MongoDB, and in to use the database best suited for the type of queries, in our case Neo4j.

The test infrastructure will be designed in a way that it will tell the developer what method or function or Which piece of code is causing the error or tests to fail. So It will be easy to find which portion of code is causing an error and the developer can fix that.\nProper test automation consists of the generation of test coverage reports as it helps in\nidentifying the areas of missing test coverage. So the generation of test reports using Codecov\nis also an important goal of this project.",

As combinatorialists are using RSK  and its generalizations in their research, as well as continuing to develop even more variations, having an extensible class structure and new algorithms from recent research implemented in SageMath will increase SageMath's utility.",

Further, these containers can be deployed over a Kubernetes cluster giving a powerful orchestration capability.",

The mobile app will have features take a image and classify it using the classification model and show the necessary information.Currently the classification model is already build. But both the mobile client and backend to integrated mobile client and classification model has to be built from scratch.

Creating an open source tool to do this will aid these projects in generating accurate SBOM information at release time. This tool should be implemented as a command line, so it can be incorporated into builds, and options can be added. Goal is that projects that use SPDX identifiers can automatically generate a SPDX document as a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) on demand (build, release, etc.).",

Even when users are interested in a handful of syscalls, strace will intercept all syscall made by the observed processes, involving several context switches per syscall.Since Linux 3.5, userspace applications can rely on seccomp-bpf to filter the syscalls they want to trace. In that case, the set of monitored syscalls is filtered in the kernel, using cBPF, before any context switch to userspace. strace could leverage seccomp-bpf to avoid tracing syscalls users don't want.\nThe tracing landscape of Linux also drastically evolved in recent years. In particular, user applications can rely on eBPF programs to filter and aggregate data of interest in the kernel, with low overhead.During this Google Summer of Code, I will finish and merge the works started to 1) rely on seccomp-bpf to filter syscalls in kernel space and 2) allow strace to use alternative backends. That second work will come with a tracepoint/BPF proof of concept to ensure strace supports diverse backends, beyond the usual ptrace model.",

Sympy can easily be implemented in other programs as a computing engine because it's fast as compared to many other libraries and languages for computation. \nThe other objective of this project is to improve Lfortran and implement it as an interactive computational environment in Fortran and a library with an effective API in Python.

To mitigate this problem, multiple methods have been proposed to add intrinsic rewards or “curiosity” to existing algorithms to extend the capability of these algorithms.This project will implement three curiosity modules to TF-Agents: pseudocount-based exploration via Context Tree Switching (CTS), Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM), and Random Network Distillation (RND).

Once this is done, the existing OODT Distributed Configuration Management feature will be integrated with this tool to handle dynamic configuration management. As a later step, the deployment could be upgraded to work with Helm or KNative.Through this project, OODT will gain the ability to seamlessly manage OODT components regardless of the deployment environment. Technologies including Docker, Kubernetes and Maven will be required to carry out this project.",

Mnemonic has two memory service based on “NVML”. On december 2017 NVML has changed it’s name into PMDK and has also started growing its libraries and tools. So, we need to upgrade Mnemonic volatile and nonvolatile memory service according to PMDK libraries.

The transpiled Javascript will run in any browser similar to Typescript.The Eclipse IDE was once heavily used for Android development.

Motivated by the potential impact of APR, in this project, we propose to build a repair framework that improves upon on past successful work VFix and S3.In this project, we aim to fix NPE bugs. We will use data flow analysis as proposed in VFix to accurately localize buggy code fragments in program under repair. We then use S3 to semantically reason about the identified buggy code fragments via dynamic symbolic execution on test cases. However, simply relying on test cases may not be sufficient. We thus plan to further enhance the semantic reasoning in S3 with the ability to leverage user-provided annotations. After this step, we obtain a set of constraints that constitutes specifications of the program. We then propose a program synthesis technique that improve the template-based repair in VFix and syntax-guided synthesis in S3 to synthesize repairs.",

A coherent ecosystem of computational tools and packages allow researchers to quickly implement and test their ideas. For bioinformatics, Julia already offers such an ecosystem in the form of the BioJulia & EcoJulia projects, and additional independent packages.\nThis project will add sequence assembly tools to the BioJulia ecosystem, specifically: 1) DBG construction from reads, 2) UG construction from a DBG and 3) Constructing contigs using unitigs.

This also affected cups-filters as a whole, because it was unable to build. Hence, it was very important to find a solution to this problem.The most plausible solution to overcome this problem is to instead of directly using the unstable internal APIs we can use stable APIs and rewrite any functionality which isn't even in stable APIs.",

The overall performance of this kind of networks are strongly influenced by the characteristics of the signal propagation through the wireless link, thereby, a proper modeling of the channel behavior is of primary importance to obtain reliable results from the simulations. This project aims to tackle this issue by proposing an extension of the spectrum module to model both frequency and spatial-dependent phenomena, and to account for the directional behavior of the signal propagation. This will be achieved by implementing the modeling framework described in 3GPP TR 38.901, which includes the statistical characterization of different propagation environments, supports the modeling of multi-antenna systems, and, thanks to its modularity, can be easily extended with new environments or other additional features. Even if it has been specifically designed for the simulation of cellular networks, it supports frequency bands between 0.5 and 100 GHz, thus can be used even for other wireless technologies.",

I have chosen this as a model as it has proven capable of running on Linux, Windows, and MacOS systems. While my work may focus initially on either Windows and the Portable Executable (PE) or Linux and Executable and Linkable Format (ELF), this approach will hopefully ensure a path forward that will eventually be capable of producing executable binaries on all popular modern operating systems.The basic method which the .NET Core uses to create executable binaries is by creating a manifest of information in the operating system dependent executable binary format which is linked to .NET’s runtime library, and handed to a .NET “main” function which executes the user program.",

But at the same time allow them to be dynamically generated (instead having them necessarily be fixed/static).3.Allow user's to configure their incoming webhooks bots based on certain parameters that we can specify on an integration-per-integration basis.4.Create a systematic and convenient way to allow integrations to make a callback request to a third-party API to gain extra information about events as required.5.Making miscellaneous improvements and tweaks that pop up over the course of the summer to specific integrations. Add new integrations as needed.The second part of this project involves improving Zulip's OpenAPI documentation system (the supporting code and tests, not necessarily writing the actual documentation itself).",
